<p>This page provides some orientation for newcomers to Web internationalization who don't really know where to start. The aim is to ease you gently into some of the material on the site.</p>
<p>You can find a selection of more detailed articles using the links to the right. Once you get some ideas from this page, you will probably just use the <a href="/International/resource-index">topic index</a>, the <a href="/International/technique-index">techniques index</a>, or the site search.</p>

<h2><a href="#what">What's it about?</a></h2>
<div class="insidenote"> <strong>Learn more...</strong>
<p><a href="../questions/qa-what-is-encoding">Character encodings for beginners</a> explains some of the basic concepts about character encodings, and why you should care. </p>
<p><a href="../articles/definitions-characters/">Character encodings: Essential concepts</a> provides explanations of terminology such as Unicode, character sets, coded character sets, character encodings, the document character set, and character escapes.</p>
</div>
<p>A character set is a collection of letters and symbols used in a writing system. For example, the ASCII character set covers letters and
symbols for English text, ISO-8859-6 covers letters and symbols needed for many languages based on the Arabic script, and the Unicode character set
contains characters for most of the living languages and scripts in the world.</p>
<p>Characters in a character set are stored as one or more bytes in a computer. Each byte or sequence of bytes represents a given character.
A character encoding is the key that maps a particular byte or sequence of bytes to particular characters that the font renders as text.</p>
<p>There are many different character encodings. If the wrong encoding is applied to the bytes in memory, the result will be unintelligible
text. It is therefore important, if people are to read your content, that you correctly label the character encoding used.</p>

<h2><a href="#choosing">Choosing an encoding</a></h2>
<div class="sidenoteGroup">
<p><strong>Everyone developing content</strong>, whether content authors or programmers, should use the UTF-8 character encoding, unless there are very special reasons for using something else. (If you decide to not use UTF-8, you must choose one of the few encodings that are interoperably implemented across all browsers.)</p>

<h2><a href="#using">Declaring and applying an encoding</a></h2>
<div class="sidenoteGroup">
<p><strong>Content developers and programmers</strong> must ensure that the character encoding used for a document or page is declared in the right way.</p>
<p>You must also ensure that your data is saved in the encoding you have chosen, it is not sufficient to just label it.</p>
<p>(Note that with  XHTML, encoding declarations are not always straightforward; they require an understanding of <a href="/International/articles/serving-xhtml/">'standards' vs.
'quirks' modes</a>, and the impact of the XML declaration.) </p>
<p><strong>Content developers and webmasters</strong> may also need to ensure that the <em>server</em> delivers content with the correct character encoding
declarations, since server settings can override in-document declarations.</p>

<h2><a href="#escapes">Escapes</a></h2>
<div class="sidenoteGroup">
<p>Escapes are a way of representing a character using only ASCII text. They provide a way of representing
characters that are not available in the character encoding you are using, or a way of avoiding the use of the character for other reasons (such as
when they may conflict with syntax). You should be clear on when and how these escapes should be used.</p>
