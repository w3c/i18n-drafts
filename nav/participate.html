<p>The Internationalization Activity welcomes the participation of individuals and organizations around the world to help improve the appropriateness of the Web for multiple cultures, scripts and languages.</p>
<p>We are always looking for people who can help us (a) understand the state of the international Web, and requirements for improving it, (b) review specifications and support developers, and (c) develop or review educational materials for content developers and others.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="about#groups">list of W3C Internationalization groups</a>, which provides information about github repositories, mailing lists, and home pages.</p>





<section>
<h2 id="benefits"><a href="#benefits">Benefits of participation</a></h2>
<p>Participation can benefit the participant and his or her organization in the following ways.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Significantly develop your understanding of how W3C technologies are used in a global Web and bring that knowledge back to your organization.</li>
				<li>Review the state of the art  in a range of Web technologies and develop understanding of key  internationalization issues by reviewing specifications.</li>
				<li>Raise your profile and that of your organization by developing best practices, and education and outreach materials.</li>
				<li>Contribute your and your organization's ideas and needs for the development of new specifications. </li>
				<li>Discuss and explore ideas  alongside other leaders in the field.</li>
				<li>Gain exposure to internationalization issues in a wide range of technologies.</li>
				<li>Lay claim to contributing directly to making the World Wide Web more worldwide.</li>

<h2 id="joining"><a href="#joining">Join the Internationalization Working Group</a> (i18n WG)</h2>
<p>The Internationalization  Working Group  provides a wide range of advice and support for groups developing or using international aspects of the Web. It reviews specifications produced by other W3C Working Groups, looking for  issues that would cause barriers to deployment and use of Web technologies due to language, script, region or culture, and  discusses issues with those groups. It also produces its own documents and content. This includes requirements, guidelines and proposals for specification writers, as well as educational resources, checkers and  outreach to help developers and content authors better understand and more widely implement the internationalization aspects of W3C technology. The group also develops tests for internationalization features on the Web, and produces summaries of their results.</p>

<h2 id="join_layout"><a href="#join_layout">Join a layout task force</a></h2>
<p>Under the umbrella of the i18n IG, and supported by the i18n WG, there are a number of initiatives in place to identify international typography problems experienced by Web users and content authors. The task forces identify and analyse the gaps that exist, document the related requirements, and help spec developers and browser implementers to introduce support for needed local features.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/International/i18n-drafts/nav/languagedev" class="eyecatcher">layout &amp; typography page</a> for a list of task forces, and information about how to contribute. </p>

<h2 id="join_its"><a href="#join_its">Join the ITS IG</a></h2>
<p>The ITS (Internationalization Tag Set) Interest Group aims to foster a community of users of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its/">Internationalization Tag Set (ITS)</a> by promoting its adoption and gathering information for its further development. ITS provides a set of concepts that can be mapped to markup and that make it easier to internationalize and localize documents. The group works through a public list and wiki, and monthy teleconference calls.</p>

<h2><a href="#translate">Review a spec</a></h2>
<p>One of the core activities of the Internationalization Working Group is to check specifications for internationalization issues. We are always looking for help with this, and the benefit goes two ways, since you learn about bleeding edge technology while reviewing the spec.</p>
<p>We also encourage Working Groups to do their own self-review.</p>
