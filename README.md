# i18n-drafts
A place to edit articles, tutorials, and the like for the /International subtree of the W3C site.  Also, captures issues and comments.

Note that this is only a temporary location for articles, etc., while they are being edited and approved. The canonical location for the resulting pages is under https://www.w3.org/International/.

To view a page as HTML, go to https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/ and add the appropriate path to the file you want to view. You'll need to provide the filename plus language extension as a minimum, eg. https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text.en

If you want to translate one or more of these resources, see the [Translation intructions](https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-drafts/pages/translation) page.
