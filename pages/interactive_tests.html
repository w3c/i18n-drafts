  <p>The language enablement work of the W3C involves documenting gaps in  Web support for users of a given language or script, and then requesting that those gaps be addressed by spec developers or browser implementers.</p>
<p>Interactive test files provide flexibility and ease of use that is useful for experimental gap-analysis testing. These tests allow you to experiment, and quickly create tests, document them, and record results. They are particularly useful for tests which are likely to result in slightly different results across a number of languages, or for testing features that involve many permutations in the input data. They are also useful for simply exploring what might happen in certain situations.</p>
<p>This page describes practical steps for creating and managing interactive tests to support the write-up of a gap.</p>
</section>





<section id="pipeline">
<h2>The test index &amp; other pages</h2>

<p>The main entry point for finding interactive tests that already exist (and tests in the Internationalization Test Suite) is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-tests/">Internationalization Tests</a> page.</p>
<p>Under the heading <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-tests/#interactive">Interactive tests &amp; results</a> there are 3 subheadings.</p>





<section id="results_summary">
<h3>Results summary pages</h3>

<p>Results summary pages bring together a high-level view of results for a particular topic area. The topics coincide with the sections in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/typography/">Language Enablement Index</a>.</p>
<p>This is the place to go to if you want to find an existing test, or check whether a test already exists.</p>
<figure id="fig_results_page">

<figcaption>A view of the results summary page for <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-tests/results/int-inline-notes-annotations">Inline Notes &amp; Annotations</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>These results summary pages are HTML-based, and the framework is created by the staff. The data, however, is pulled at run time from the GitHub issues list, and the location and results tables are determined by the labels set for the GitHub issue relevant for a particular test.</p>
<p>Tests are grouped by language, and then by subsections containing related tests.</p>
<p>Each test occupies a line, which contains a link to a GitHub issue that contains detailed results information and links to the actual tests, the assertion associated with the test, and a set of results.</p>
</section>






<section id="test_rigs">
<h3>Test rigs</h3>

<p>The test rigs allow you to set up new tests yourself and produce a URL to capture the test so that it can be shared or stored.</p>
<p>This is the place to go to if you want to find an existing test, or check whether a test already exists.</p>

</figure>


<p>A test rig page will allow you to set language, font and font-size, and the dimensions of the test bounding box. You can then add some text or markup and see what it looks like. Below the test bounding box you'll usually find fields to allow you to apply various CSS property values.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the page is a button that creates a URL for you. That URL captures all the settings on a page, and can be copied wherever you like, so that others can view the test you set up.</p>
<p>W3C staff create these test rigs. A <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/exploratory/vanilla/">Vanilla canvas</a> is also provided, and can be useful for setting up many kinds of tests if you don't need to apply the CSS properties.</p>
</section>






<section id="repositories">
<h3>Repositories</h3>

<p>The detailed test results, as mentioned, are stored in GitHub issues. Each issue is in one of three repositories, which are named according to the major sections in the Language Enablement Index. This section on the test index page points you to those repositories.</p>
<p>The repositories are another useful place to find existing tests, because the labels used for each issue allow you to filter the list by language, by topic area, or by results for a particular user agent, etc.</p>
<p>You will also need to go to one of the repositories if you have created a test and you want to add it to the list of existing tests (details about how to do that can be found here).</p>

<section id="gap_description">
<h2>How to create an exploratory test</h2>

<p>It's very easy to create an exploratory test.</p>
<p>First, check whether the test already exists, using the links described above on the test index page. If you don't find what you want, you can start with an empty test rig, or modify an existing test.</p>
<p>To create a completely new test page start with either the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/exploratory/vanilla/">vanilla test rig</a>, or <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-tests/#test_rigs">another test rig</a> which has appropriate CSS property settings.</p>
<p>Add whatever text or markup you need to the controls on the test rig page. When you click on <samp>Go</samp> the text is displayed in one or more boxes below with orange borders.

Controls at the top of the page allow you to set various parameters, including the dimensions of the test box. Controls lower down are typically associated with CSS properties, and allow you to set various property values on the text in the orange box(es).

</p>
<p>If you have created a test and want to point people to it in an email or GitHub thread, or save it in one of the GitHub repositories we use, click on the button <samp>Take a snapshot</samp> at the bottom of the page. This will produce a URL which you can copy to wherever you like. Anyone who follows the URL will see the page exactly as it was when you snapped it.</p>
</section>






<section id="saving">
<h2>Saving a test to a GitHub repo</h2>

<p>To save a test for posterity in one of the GitHub repositories dedicated to interactive tests, follow these steps. We will assume that you have already created the test, and have also created a snapshot URL for that test.</p>




<section id="choose_a_repo">
<h3>Choose the appropriate repo</h3>

<p>Your test will usually belong under one or more of the subsection headings in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/typography/">Language Enablement Index</a>. The choice of repository corresponds to the higher level heading of the index that contains the relevant subsection. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/w3c/text_direction_tests/issues">Text direction</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/w3c/character_phrase_tests/issues">Characters &amp; phrases</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/w3c/line_paragraph_tests/issues">Lines &amp; paragraphs</a></li>
</ul>
</section>







<section id="create_an_issue">
<h3>Create an issue</h3>

<p>From the GitHub issue page you chose, click on the green <samp>New Issue</samp> button, and then select <samp>Add a test</samp>. A template will appear. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a <strong>brief assertion</strong> to the subject line. This describes what the test is checking. It will be used in the results summary pages, as well as for the issues list.</li>
<li>Add the <strong>snapshot URL</strong> for the test you created to the top line. You can add more than one of these lines, if needed. You can also briefly annotate them, so that someone can get an idea about what the test does.</li>
<li>Add a brief <strong>set of instructions</strong> that detail how you know whether or not the test passes. This line can also briefly describe how the test works, where that is useful.</li>
<li><strong>Fill in the results</strong>. The template provides 3 lines, for Gecko, Blink, and Webkit (but if needed it should be possible to add more). You are encouraged to run the test on all three of these engines to give an indicatio of the interoperability of the feature you are testing.
<ol>
<li>If the test passes, delete the ✘.  If it fails, delete ✓. If it partially passes, leave both ✓✘.</li>
<li>The browser name and version and the OS are indicated at the bottom of the test page, and can be copied from there.</li>
<li>Add any comments you feel are useful. Comments should always appear if the test only partially passes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add a <strong>link to the appropriate results page</strong> (<a href="https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-tests/#results_summary_pages">see a list</a>). This helps people viewing this test to find related tests.</li>
</ol>
</section>








<section id="github_labels">
<h3>GitHub issue labels</h3>

<p>Labels  are used to automatically populate the results pages, and to allow for filtering of issues in the GitHub repos.</p>
<p>Add the following labels if you are able, or otherwise ask someone else in the Internationalization Working Group to do so.</p>
<p> The required labels are:</p>

<ol>
<li>one or more labels beginning with <span translate="no" style="background-color:#fbca04; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">doc:</span>. These labels indicate which results page this test will appear on. It's fine to have more than one such label, if you think the topic is equally applicable to more than one topic.</li>
<li>one or more labels beginning with <span translate="no" style="background-color:#d4d6f8; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">h2:</span>. These labels indicate the level 2 section(s) on results page where this test will appear. It will usually be a language name, since the tests are first grouped by language on those pages.</li>
<li>one or more labels beginning with <span translate="no" style="background-color:#b30311; color:white; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">h3:</span>. These labels indicate the level 3 section(s) on results page where this test will appear, if there is one.</li>
<li>a label beginning with <span translate="no" style="background-color:white; color:black; border-radius:5px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">r:</span>, to indicate the result of the test for each of the user agent engines tested. Each of these labels has one of 3 colours: <span translate="no" style="background-color:#8dfd8c; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">r:...</span> for a pass, <span translate="no" style="background-color:#fc6669; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">r:...</span> for a fail, and <span translate="no" style="background-color:#fdca6c; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">r:...</span> for a partial result. Choose the label with the appropriate user agent and colour combination.</li>
</ol>
