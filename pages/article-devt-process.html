<div id="mainLayout">
<section>
  <p>This page describes stages in article development within the Internationalization Working Group. Not every step is required. It is intended more as a guide. There are however points where group agreement is needed to move forward, and these are required.</p>

  <p>This is provided for new group members to become familiar with the way we work.</p>
</section>





<section id="intent">
    <h2>Stage: Intent</h2>

    <p class="begin"><strong>This stage begins when:</strong> <br>An author indicates that they intend to create an article, on the WG mailing list or during a teleconference.</p>
		<p>For FAQs, authors are encouraged to send out the wording of the proposed question for suggestions from the group.</p>
</section>

<section id="brainstorm">
  <h2>Stage: Brainstorm</h2>

  <p class="begin"><strong>This stage begins when:</strong> <br>The author produces some questions or a proposed list of topics to be covered by
    the material, and asks for comments.</p>
  <p>After making a first stab at an article, the author may:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>review ideas with the chair/team contact</li>
    <li>request that WG participants help in brainstorming to frame a topic, or discussing ideas that are still needing development. This may be
     done in email or by telecon. Preferably, email would precede telecon discussions. The author should ask the team contact to schedule a discussion for
     a telecon.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="initial">
  <h2>Stage: Initial draft</h2>
  <p class="begin"><strong>This stage begins when:</strong> <br>The author produces a first draft of the proposed text and announces it on the
    WG mailing list, asking for comments.</p>
  <p>This first review stage is still to allow exploration of direction and scoping for the author. The author should be ready to substantially
    modify their draft based on comments received.</p>
  <p>WG participants may comment in email prior to any telecon discussions. Telecons should be used for discussion of points that are
    difficult to handle in email. [Note to telecon participants: it is not good form to discuss a draft at the telecon without having at least read the
    draft and thought about it in advance.]</p>
  <p>Comments on small editorial nits are likely to be less relevant at this stage. </p>
</section>

<section id="wd">
  <h2>Stage: Working draft</h2>
  <p class="begin"><strong>This stage begins when:</strong> <br>The author produces a new draft, incorporating all appropriate comments received on the
    initial draft, and sends a call for comments on the WG mailing list.</p>
  <p>The author should try to make this as near as possible to publication ready. See the
    <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/editing">editorial guidelines for i18n docs</a>.</p> 
  <p>The team contact/chair will usually be involved from an editorial point of view at this stage. This may include discussions about wording,
    as well as checking for compliance with the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/editing">editorial guidelines</a>.</p> 
  <p>WG participants, send in comments by email or request a discussion during a telecon.</p> 
  <p>A decision should be taken during a teleconference whether to move this on to the next stage. Agreement may be reached on stipulation that a
    small number of fine edits to the text be made first. If more substantial changes are needed, the author goes away to work on the document and brings
    it to another telecon to seek agreement to take to the next stage.</p>
</section>

<section id="review">
  <h2>Stage: Wide review</h2>
  <p class="begin"><strong>This stage begins when:</strong> <br>The group agrees during a teleconference to move the document to wide
    review.</p>
  <p>The author incorporates any comments agreed during the telecon when the decision was made to send for wide review.</p> 
  <p>The team contact then announces this article on the www-international list, at
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/">https://www.w3.org/International/</a>, and on the @webi18n Mastodon/Twitter channel inviting comments.</p> 
  <p>As comments come in, the author makes any necessary additional changes to the document.</p>
</section>

<section id="pub">
  <h2>Stage: Publication</h2>
  <p class="begin"><strong>This stage begins when:</strong> <br>The group agrees during a teleconference to publish the document.</p>
  <p>The author obtains final sign-off for publication from WG participants during a telecon.</p> 
  <p>The team contact/chair finalizes any required editorial work.</p> 
  <p>The team contact then adds links to various places on the /International site, and sends out notifications.</p>
