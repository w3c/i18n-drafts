  <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/fontlist/index.html">Font lister</a><br>
            Browser-based app. Provides a (not exhaustive) list of fonts, grouped by script, that are available via the Windows and macOS operating systems, as well as Google's Noto fonts and SIL fonts. Note that some of the Windows and macOS fonts have to be downloaded by the user before they can be applied to text.</p></li>
  </ul>
</section>



<section id="characters">
  <h2><a href="#characters">Characters & encoding</a></h2>
  <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-conversion/">Unicode code converter</a><br>
            Browser-based app. Converts between characters, Unicode code point numbers, UTF-8 and UTF-16 code units in hex, Numeric Character References (hex and decimal), percent-encoded text, and other character escape formats.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/uniview/">UniView</a><br>
            Browser-based app.
		  UniView is a Unicode character viewer/picker that  displays  characters from a selected range or search pattern, provides information about them, and allows you to assemble strings from them like in a character map.  You can also create customizable lists of characters for pasting into documents. UniView supports the latest version of the Unicode Standard, including the supplementary planes as well as the BMP. Characters are displayed as graphics by default, but you can also display them using an installed font.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-analysestring/index.html">Analyse string tool</a><br>
            Browser-based app.
            Lists the characters in text that you paste into the large box at the top, and produces information about each character.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-encodings/">Encoding converter</a><br>
            Browser-based app. Allows you to see how Unicode characters are represented by bytes in various legacy encodings, and vice versa. You can customise the encodings. The algorithms used are based on those described in the Encoding specification, and thus describe the behaviour you can expect from web browsers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-listcharacters/">List characters tool</a><br>
            Browser-based app. Analyses the characters in text that you paste into the large box at the top, and produces a list of what characters were used, grouped by Unicode block.</p>
        </li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section id="language">
  <h2><a href="#language">Language tags</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/">IANA Language Subtag Registry search tool</a><br>
				  Browser-based app. Look for subtags by searching on the descriptions in the registry. Look up subtags and sequences of subtags. List the various types of
				tag currently available. Runs on the most up-to-date version of the registry.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
</section>


<section id="segmentation">
  <h2><a href="#segmentation">Grapheme segmentation</a></h2>
  <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/apps/graphemes/index.html">Grapheme segmenter</a><br>
            Browser-based app. Parses a string and shows extended grapheme cluster boundaries.</p></li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section id="other">
  <h2><a href="#other">Other</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/">W3C Internationalization Checker</a><br>
        Performs various tests on a Web Page to determine its level of internationalisation-friendliness. It also lists key internationalization settings related to character encoding, language declarations, text direction and class/id names. This information includes HTTP headers, which can be particularly useful for troubleshooting problems. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-counters/">Counter styles converter</a><br>
        Browser-based app. Allows you to convert ASCII numbers into other representations that can be used to create counters for ordered lists, headings, figures, etc. It uses the algorithms described by CSS3 Counter Styles and Predefined Counter Styles. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/">Unicode character pickers</a><br>
        Browser-based app. The pickers allow you to produce, analyse and manipulate runs of text for a given language or script. The pickers support well over 100 orthographies in over 90 different scripts. They are particularly useful for people not familiar with a script, but the optimisations, conversion tools, etc, can also be helpful to more experienced users.    </p>
