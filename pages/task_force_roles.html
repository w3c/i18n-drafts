<h1>Layout task force roles</h1>

<div id="mainLayout">
<section>
  <p>The W3C Internationalization Interest Group contains a number of task forces dedicated to assessing and documenting language support for a given set of languages. See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/groups/" rel="nofollow">list of task forces</a>. See an <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-discuss/wiki/Analysing-support-for-text-layout-on-the-Web">overview</a> of how task forces work.</p>
<p>This page summarises various roles people can adopt within such a group. One person may play more than one role, play different roles per document, or switch between roles over time. Involvement becomes greater as you read down the page.</p>
<p>All followers and participants receive a single digest email (no more than one a day) whenever there are changes GitHub issues related to their task force. The issues may originate in the task force itself, or may be raised by other W3C Working Groups in the course of their work.</p>
</section>



<section id="how-to-get-involved">
<h2>How to get involved</h2>

<p>If you want a low level of commitment, get involved as a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/wiki/Layout-task-force-roles/#followercontributor">Follower/contributor</a>.</p>
<p>If you have the time and inclination to get involved on a more regular basis, consider joining the group as a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/wiki/Layout-task-force-roles/#participant">Participant</a>.  Participants follow the GitHub activity closely, look for opportunities to provide feedback and suggestions, and attend teleconferences/meetings where possible.</p>
<p>We are always looking for people to take a more active role in the group by taking on responsibility for producing work as an <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/wiki/Layout-task-force-roles/#editor">Editor</a> and/or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/wiki/Layout-task-force-roles/#co-chair">(Co-)chair</a>.</p>
<p>See the role descriptions below. Group-specific links to the CONTRIBUTING.md file, meeting info, chair/staff contact email, etc. can be found in the lower part of the group's GitHub home page.</p>
</section>

<div style="clear: both;">




<section id="follower_contributor">
<h2>Follower/contributor</h2>
<p>Followers are simply subscribers to the mailing list which receives notifications from the GitHub repository. They are encouraged to provide occasional comments related to issues or document review.</p>
<p>A follower/contributor:</p>

<ul>
<li>follows and may comment on GitHub issues, and may review documents</li>
<li>may occasionally propose content for the group's document deliverables, but if that content is accepted or is provided via a pull request, will be asked to agree to the contributor guidelines, if they havenâ€™t already done so</li>
<li>does not participate in teleconferences/meetings</li>
<li>is not listed in the credits at the top of the document, but may be included in the acknowledgment section</li>
<li>is not listed in the group membership database</li>
</ul>

<p>To follow the work, simply subscribe to the task force's mailing list.</p>
<p>It is often easiest to agree to the contributing rules at the same time as subscribing to the group, since it only needs to be done once, and then you are covered. To do so, send a brief email to the staff contact for the group saying that you have read and agree to the content of the CONTRIBUTING.md file for that group.</p>
