<h1>Documenting language  gaps</h1>


<section id="sidebarExtras">
</section>


<div id="mainLayout">
<section>
  <p>The language enablement work of the W3C involves documenting gaps in  Web support for users of a given language or script, and then requesting that those gaps be addressed by spec developers or browser implementers.</p>
<p>This page describes practical steps for editing a gap-analysis document starting from a standard template.</p>
</section>





<section id="pipeline">
<h2>The gap-analysis pipeline</h2>

<p>The gap-analysis pipeline allows us to track progress of the gaps that have been documented.</p>


<figure id="fig_ga_pipeline">
<img src="documenting_gaps-data/ga_pipeline.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
<figcaption>A view of the gap-analysis pipeline.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The pipeline contains only one card per gap, but labels indicate all the gap-analysis documents where that gap is relevant.</p>
<p>Other labels can be used to filter the information shown. For example, it is possible to show just the issues needing attention by a particular browser engine, and then to further filter that information to show only those items with a priority of 'basic'. If a browser or spec bug is fixed, the relevant label is removed so that the pipeline constantly shows the current status.</p>
<p>Other labels allow you to find all gaps related to a particular feature, such as letter-spacing, or justification, or all issues with a given priority.</p>
<p>The columns indicate what needs to happen next for a particular gap.</p>
<p>Cards in the left-most column  need additional research and/or clearer documentation before they can move to one of the other columns.</p>
<p>The aim is to move all cards into the right-hand column ('Fixed'). </p>
</section>







<section id="gap_description">
<h2>Describing a gap</h2>


<section id="the_template">
<h3>The HTML template</h3>

<p>A standard template is used for the gap-analysis documents of all groups. It is an HTML document. See, for example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/beng-gap/">Bengali gap-analysis document</a>.</p>

<figure id="fig_jlreq_pages">
<img src="documenting_gaps-data/jlreq_gaps.png" alt="" style="width: 70%;">
<figcaption>A view of part of the Bengali gap-analysis document.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The first 3 levels of headings in a gap-analysis document are fixed. They conform to a standardised set of categories that are used throughout the language enablement framework. This makes tooling work, simplifies links, and provides a useful harmonisation of approach across all the groups working on language enablement.</p>
<p>The paragraph in the HTML document immediately after the section title is intended to give you ideas about what you should write about. It is not an exhaustive list, by any means. You should leave that text in place. The links it contains may give you additional ideas of things to describe here – they link to currently outstanding questions or spec/browser bugs relating to this topic.</p>
</section>



<section id="github_issues">
<h3>GitHub issues</h3>

<p>The main content of the document is contained in small topic sections. These are authored in GitHub issues – one issue per topic, in the issue list of the group's repository.  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/iip/issues/117">Here's an example</a> of an issue.</p>

<figure id="fig_gh_issue">
<img src="documenting_gaps-data/gh_issue.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
<figcaption>Issue #117 shown in the previous figure, as it appears in GitHub.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The content is added to the first comment field in the issue list, and some standard boilerplate text is added to the second. Only the content of the first comment field will appear in the gap-analysis document.</p>
<p>People can create additional comments below the first two to suggest or contribute changes. Changes to the content are made by editing the first comment (those changes can be inspected using the available pulldown in the comment header).</p>
<p>The content of the first comment should closely follow the structure that is suggested when you create a new issue. This includes the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>(<strong>intro</strong>) how the feature is broken for users (ie. what can't they do). If there is a relevant description of how the feature is supposed to work in the requirements document or elsewhere, point to that.</li>
<li><strong>Specs:</strong> pointers to the CSS or other W3C specs that relate to this feature, with descriptions of whether the gap is addressed or not</li>
<li><strong>Tests &amp; results:</strong> links to tests or screen snaps that show the feature failing, and a summary of the results of those tests.</li>
<li><strong>Browser bug reports:</strong> links to any browser bug reports that have been raised.</li>
<li><strong>Priority:</strong> an explanation of why you assigned the priority you did.</li>
</ol>
<p>If describing gaps that affect more than one language in the same document, and there is a difference in the level of support, make it clear which language is relevant to the text.</p>
<p>See also <a href="#duplicate_gaps">the section</a> about what to do when the same gap is relevant to more than one gap-analysis document.</p>
</section>



<section id="github_labels">
<h3>GitHub issue labels</h3>

<p>Item descriptions in GitHub issues are automatically pulled into the HTML document if the right labels have been applied to that issue. (Refresh the HTML page you should see the change immediately.) Labels are also used for filtering in the gap-analysis pipeline. The required labels are:</p>

<ol>
<li>the label <span translate="no" style="background-color:#e99695; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">gap</span>.  Only issues with this label are parsed for inclusion in the gap-analysis doc.</li>
<li>a label beginning with <span translate="no" style="background-color:#C2E0C6; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">doc:</span> (eg. <span translate="no" style="background-color:#C2E0C6; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">doc:beng</span>    for the Bengali gap-analysis doc). Even if the group has only one gap-analysis doc, such as for the Chinese and Japanese groups, this label should be applied (ie. <span translate="no" style="background-color:#C2E0C6; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">doc:clreq</span> or <span translate="no" style="background-color:#C2E0C6; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">doc:jlreq</span>, respectively). There can be more than one of these labels, if the gap applies to more than one gap-analysis document in the same repo.</li>
<li>one or more labels beginning with <span translate="no" style="background-color:#fbca04; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">i:</span> (for 'index'). These labels indicate which section(s) the item will be placed in (eg. eg. <span translate="no" style="background-color:#fbca04; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">i:letter_spacing</span>), so there is a defined set of possibilities. It's fine to have more than one such label, if you think the topic is equally applicable to more than one section.</li>
<li>a label beginning with <span translate="no" style="background-color:white; color:black; border-radius:5px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">p:</span>, to indicate the priority for that issue. Each of these labels has a different colour. The usual possibilities are: <span translate="no" style="background-color:#ffa500; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">p:basic</span>, <span translate="no" style="background-color:#ffe4b5; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">p:advanced</span>, or, rarely, <span translate="no" style="background-color:red; color:white; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">p:broken</span>. If an issue has been fixed, or the text is describing the fact that there is no problem, you can use the label <span translate="no" style="background-color:green; color:white; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">p:ok</span>.</li>
<li>labels to indicate where work is needed to address the issue. These labels all begin with <span translate="no" style="background-color:#e99695; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">x:</span>. If work is required on a spec, the label will include the short-name for that spec, eg. <span translate="no" style="background-color:#e99695; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">x:css-text</span>. If a browser bug has been raised, add the name of the browser engine, eg. this will typically be one of <span translate="no" style="background-color:#e99695; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">x:blink</span>, <span translate="no" style="background-color:#e99695; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">x:gecko</span>, or <span translate="no" style="background-color:#e99695; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">x:webkit</span>. If the required fix has been provided, these labels should be removed. That way it is possible to filter the issues in the gap analysis pipeline to see what currently needs attention for a given spec or browser.</li>
<li>labels to indicate all the gap-analysis documents to which this issue applies. These labels are also used for the gap-analysis pipeline. Since a gap is reported only once in the pipeline, they give an idea of the extend of the problem where that gap applies to more than one gap-analysis document. The labels begin with <span translate="no" style="background-color:#e99695; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">x:</span>, followed by a short name for the gap-analysis document (eg. <span translate="no" style="background-color:#e99695; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">x:beng</span>, <span translate="no" style="background-color:#e99695; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">x:deva</span>, etc.). There must be at least one of these labels (corresponding to the doc: label(s) that you set).</li>
</ol>

<section id="duplicate_gaps">
<h3>When the same gap belongs in several documents</h3>

<p>In some cases, the same gap is relevant to many languages and can be reported in a number of gap-analysis documents. We try to avoid repeating all the detailed information in more than one place by adopting one of 2 strategies.</p>
<p>In some cases, a problem may have  aspects that are slightly different from language to language. In this case you may need to create more than one GitHub issue. If you do, indicate in the title of the issue which language/script this relates to.</p>
<p><strong>If the same gap applies to multiple documents in the same repository</strong> (eg. a letter-spacing issue that applies to Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, and Tamil documents, which are all stored in the same indic repository) simply record the information once, with language-specific examples if needed, and apply two or more <span translate="no" style="background-color:#C2E0C6; color:black; border-radius:5px; padding:2px 6px; font-weight:bold; font-size:80%;">doc:</span> labels. </p>
<p><strong>If the same gap applies to multiple documents across different repositories</strong> (eg. incorrect application of quotation marks, which affects most documents regardless of the repo where the gap-analysis documents are stored), then choose one repository where you will create a GitHub issue with all the details about tests, spec and browser support. This is the issue that will be tracked in the gap-analysis pipeline.</p>
<p>In the other repositories create a 'stub issue' with the same title that gives a brief introduction to the problem at hand, and optionally contains examples or tests relevant to the language(s) of that repo, but points the reader to the details you are maintaining in the other repo. To do this, after the introduction you should include something along the lines of:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>This issue is described in more detail and tracked here.</strong></p>
<p>with a link to the detailed issue. Here's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/deva-gap/#issue118_spacing">an example</a>.</p>

<section id="priorities">
<h2>Adding a priority</h2>

<p>When the HTML file pulls in the topics, it automatically works out a priority to assign to a section containing multiple topics. If several topics in the same section have different priorities assigned to them, the lowest denominator wins. The possibilities are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ok</code></li>
<li><code>na</code> (not applicable)</li>
<li><code>advanced</code> (needs work for advanced level support)</li>
<li><code>basic</code> (needs work for basic styling support)</li>
<li><code>broken</code> (basic display issues that prevent effective use of this language on the Web)</li>
</ul>
<p>The priority chosen will affect the colour of the block alongside the section, and add some summary text at the end of the section.</p>
<p>Note that this priority labelling is NOT about how badly broken the feature is – it's about how the lack of the feature affects the use of the Web in this language.</p>
<p>Basic styling is the level that would be generally accepted as sufficient for most Web pages. Advanced level support would include additional features one might expect to include in ebooks or other advanced typographic formats. There may be features of a script or language that are not supported on the Web, but that are not generally regarded as necessary (usually archaic or obscure features). In this case, the feature can be described here, but the status should be marked as <code>ok</code>.</p>

<p>The decision as to what priority level is assigned to a described gap is down to the experts doing the gap analysis. It may not always be straightforward to decide.</p>
<p>A section can be scored as <code>ok</code> if the feature in question is specified in an appropriate specification, and is supported by user agents. A specification that is in CR or later and has two implementations in 'major' browsers will count. This means that the feature may not be supported in all browsers yet. (At some point in the future we may try to distinguish, visually, whether support is available in a specification but still pending in major browsers or applications.) On the other hand, you may feel it's important to have more than two major browsers supporting the feature, in which case you can assign a problem status.</p>
<p>If a section is given a class of <code>ok</code> or <code>na</code> you can leave the description blank, or you can add explanatory text. Whatever you prefer.  It is possible to create such content in GitHub issues, or the staff contact or group editor may prefer to quickly change the HTML directly for these sections.</p>
</section>



  
<section id="tests">
<h2>Referring to tests</h2>

<p>The language enablement framework provides instructions for how to create two types of test.  The exploratory/interactive format is most likely to be used for gap-analysis work.  You can read how to create tests by following the links from the page <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-tests/wiki/Writing-i18n-tests">Writing i18n tests</a>.  The gap analysis doc should summarise the detailed results indicated for the tests it refers to.</p>
