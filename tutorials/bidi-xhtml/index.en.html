    <p>Getting bidirectional text to display correctly can sometimes appear baffling and frustrating, but it need not be so. If you have struggled with this or have yet to start, this tutorial should help you adopt the best approach to marking up your content, and explain enough of how the bidirectional algorithm works that you will understand much better the root causes of most of your problems. We will also address some common misconceptions about ways to deal with markup for bidirectional content.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="objectives">
    <h2 class="notoc">Objectives</h2>
    <p>By following this tutorial you should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>create effective HTML pages containing text written in the Arabic, Hebrew or other right-to-left scripts</li>
      <li>understand the basics of how the Unicode bidirectional algorithm works, so that you can understand why bidirectional text behaves the way it does, and how to work around problems</li>
      <li>apply the significant new additions in HTML5 to your bidi markup.</li>
      <li>take decisions about the appropriateness of alternatives to markup</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Right-to-left scripts are used by numerous languages, including Arabic, Hebrew, Pashto, Persian, Sindhi, Syriac, Thaana, Urdu, Yiddish, etc</p>

<div id="nutshell">
  <h2 id="quicksummary"><a href="#quicksummary">In a nutshell</a></h2>
  <p>Add a <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> attribute to the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag to set the default base direction of your page if it is right-to-left. Use the <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> attribute on block elements within the page only where you need to change the base direction.</p>
  <p>For inline text, <a  class="termref" href="/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/#unknownuc">tightly wrap</a> all <a class="termref" href="/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/#oppositedirection">opposite-direction phrases</a> in markup that sets their base direction.</p>
  <p>Use <code>dir=auto</code> to automatically set the base direction of form fields, <code class="kw" translate="no">pre</code> elements or text inserted into the page. Use the <code class="kw" translate="no">dirname</code> attribute if you need to pass information about the base direction of form input to the server.</p>
  <p>Avoid using CSS or Unicode control codes for managing direction where you can use markup.</p>
  <p>Use logical ordering of bidirectional text, rather than visual ordering, and let the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm take the strain.</p>

    <dt><dfn id="term_bidirectional">Bidirectional text</dfn></dt>
    <dd>In languages that use right-to-left scripts any embedded text from a left-to-right script and all numbers progress visually left-to-right within the  right-to-left visual flow of the text. (Of course,  English text on this page could also contain bidirectional text if it included, say, Arabic and Hebrew examples.)</dd>
    <dd>Bidirectional text is commonplace in right-to-left scripts such as Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, and Thaana. Numerous different languages are written with these scripts, including Arabic, Hebrew, Pashto, Persian, Sindhi, Syriac, Dhivehi, Urdu, Yiddish, etc.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="term_bidi">Bidi</dfn></dt>
    <dd>A short form for 'bidirectional'.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="term_rtl">RTL</dfn></dt>
    <dd>A short form for 'right-to-left'.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="term_ltr">LTR</dfn></dt>
    <dd>A short form for 'left-to-right'.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="term_base_direction">Base direction</dfn></dt>
    <dd>In order for text to look right when an HTML page is displayed, we need to establish the directional context of that text. We  refer to that directional context as the 'base direction'.</dd>
    <dd>It is fundamentally important to establish the appropriate base direction for text so that the bidirectional algorithm  produces the expected ordering of the  text when displayed. Correct specification of the base direction also establishes a proper default alignment for the text.</dd>
    <dd>In HTML the base direction is either set explicitly by the nearest parent element that uses the <span class="kw" translate="no">dir</span> attribute, or, in the absence of such an attribute, the base direction is inherited from the default direction of the document, which is left-to-right (LTR).</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="term_uba">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UBA), often referred to as just the 'bidi algorithm', is part of the Unicode Standard. It describes an algorithm used when determining the directionality for bidirectional Unicode text and is widely supported by web browsers and other applications. For the details, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode Standard Annex #9</a>.</dd>

  <h2 id="markup"><a href="#markup">Markup for text direction</a></h2>
  <p>In this section we cover the basics of markup for text direction.</p>
  <p><a href="/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics" class="maintitle print"><cite>Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</cite></a> provides a gentle introduction to how the bidi algorithm works, highlighting concepts and terminology that you'll need to understand how to work with bidirectional text.</p>
  <p><a href="/International/questions/qa-html-dir" class="maintitle print"><cite>Structural markup and right-to-left text in HTML</cite></a> looks at basic usage of the <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> attribute at the document level and for structural markup in HTML, eg. things like paragraphs, tables, and forms. It also looks at new developments in HTML5 for dealing with direction in form elements, <code class="kw" translate="no">pre</code> elements and inserted text.</p>
  <p><a href="/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/" class="maintitle print"><cite>Inline markup and bidirectional text in HTML</cite></a> begins by describing situations in which the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm needs help from markup. The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm is the basis for directional control of text in all browsers, but it has its limitations, and those need to be met with markup. The article looks at the problems and proposes simple solutions. This is somewhat more complicated than the previous article, because it is where you have to handle bidirectional text. </p>
  <p><a href="/International/questions/qa-visual-vs-logical" class="maintitle print"><cite>Visual vs. logical ordering of text</cite></a> compares visual vs. logical approaches to storing bidirectional text and makes the case for the logical model. These days you are generally unlikely to have to deal with visually-ordered content.</p>

  <h2 id="browser"><a href="#browser">CSS and Unicode control characters</a></h2>
  <p>Generally speaking you should manage text direction in HTML using markup rather than CSS or Unicode control characters, although there are places where the latter is the only resort. These articles look into the reasons for this in detail.</p>
  <p><a href="/International/questions/qa-bidi-css-markup" class="maintitle print"><cite>CSS vs. markup for bidi
    support</cite></a></p>
  <p><a href="/International/questions/qa-bidi-controls" class="maintitle print"><cite>Unicode controls vs. markup for bidi support</cite></a> discusses why markup is better than Unicode control characters, where it is available. </p>
  <p><a href="/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls" class="maintitle print"><cite>Using Unicode controls for bidi text</cite></a> explains how to use Unicode control characters where they are the only option. </p>
