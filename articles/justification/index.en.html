  <p>This article gives a high level summary of various typographic strategies for fully justifying text on a line and in a paragraph for a variety of scripts, and offers some advice to authors and implementers.</p>
  <p>Since the amount of content on a line tends to vary, even if minutely, from line to line within a paragraph, typographers have come up with various methods for effective full justification – causing the text to completely fill the line – in order to create visual alignment on both edges of a paragraph.</p>
  <p>Typographic conventions for full text justification depend on the writing system, the content language, and the calligraphic style of the text. Results also tend to vary based on the capabilities of the layout engine and a given typographer’s preferences for weighing its various detrimental effects on typographic color and readability.</p>
  <p>This article provides a hint at some of the different strategies used in different writing systems, but the devil is very much in the detail. Furthermore, other factors such as line-break rules, hyphenation, and other inline features, have to be taken into account during justification.</p>
  <p>For more detailed information about how justification happens in various scripts, see <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/#justification">International text layout and typography index</a>.</p>

      <section id="justification_zh">
        <h3 id="chinese"><a href="#chinese">Chinese Writing System (Han Ideographs)</a></h3>
        <p>Historically, Chinese was written as Han ideographs, with no punctuation.
          Under this system, justification was automatic,
          as the characters fit perfectly into a square grid.
          However, the introduction of punctuation in recent centuries,
          plus the increase in mixed-script text
          (such as the inclusion of European numbers and/or words, phrases, names, and trademarks)
          has created a need for adjustments within a line.</p>
        <p>Chinese notably does not use word spaces,
          so these do not provide a justification opportunity within the lines;
          thus justification techniques focus on adjustments to spacing around punctuation,
          script-change boundaries,
          and inter-character spacing.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="justification_ja">
        <h3 id="japanese"><a href="#japanese">Japanese Writing System</a></h3>
        <p>Like Chinese, Japanese was historically written in Han ideographs;
          however it has since developed its own phonetic scripts
          Hiragana and Katakana (collectively, Kana).
          While pure kana texts do exist,
          particularly in children’s literature,
          Han ideographs (Kanji, in Japanese) continue to be an integral part of normal Japanese text,
          and are interspersed with kana within a sentence.</p>
        <p>Like Chinese,
          embraced European-inspired punctuation, numerals, and other foreign snippets
          that don’t conform to the standard full-width character grid.
          The Japanese writing system also does not use word spaces,
          and similarly focuses on adjustments to spacing around punctuation,
          script-change boundaries,
          and inter-character spacing,
          with a notable preference for compression of intra-glyph spacing
          over expansion between glyphs.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="justification_ko">
        <h3>Korean Writing System</h3>
        <p>Like Japanese, Korean was historically written in pure Han ideographs,
          and has since developed its own phonetic script, Hangul.
          Also like Japanese, it has adopted punctuation and numerals.
          However, unlike Japanese, Korean has also adopted word spaces,
          and tends towards narrow (Western-style, rather than full-width) punctuation.
          This allows it to use inter-word justification:
          as in English publications, this method stretches the spaces between words
          in order to fill the line.</p>
        <p>While Han ideographs (Hanja, in Korean) were kept as part of the writing system,
          they have become increasingly scarce over time
          such that many documents are written in pure Hangul,
          and some only use Hanja as inline annotations for disambiguation among homophones
          rather than as part of the main text.
          However, Hanja and Hangul together remain important components of Korean writing.</p>

        <h3>Latin (Roman) Writing System</h3>
        <p>Quite possibly the writing system familiar to more people than any other,
          the Latin writing system derives from the Roman alphabet,
          including a few additional characters and diacritic marks
          to accommodate languages such as Icelandic and modern Vietnamese.
          Thanks to the Europeans in the Age of Exploration,
          their missionaries,
          and the Western-dominated global scholastic culture of the modern age,
          most languages in the world have one or more Latin transcriptions,
          even those that do not use it as their primary writing system.</p>
        <p>The Latin alphabet is a phonetic system with disjoint letterforms,
          and typically uses spaces between words.
          This allows it to use inter-word justification,
          although it can and sometimes does increase the spacing between individual letters as well.
          Since it is frequently adopted into other writing systems,
          it can sometimes adopt characteristics of that system;
          for example, some styles of Japanese typesetting
          treat Latin letters the same as Japanese characters
          for the purpose of line-breaking and justification.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="justification_ethi">
        <h3>Ethiopic Writing System</h3>
        <p>Like Latin, the Ethiopic writing system uses an alphabet of disjoint letters
          and uses punctuation to indicate the break between words.
          Unlike Latin, Ethiopic traditionally uses a visible word separator—<wbr/>
          the Ethiopic Word Space U+1361 “፡”—<wbr/>
          although modern documents sometimes use a regular space U+0020 “ ” instead.
          Justification strategies are as for Latin:
          increasing the space at the word separator,
          and/or distributing space between letters.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="justification_arab">
        <h3> Arabic Writing System (and Other Cursive Systems)</h3>
        <p>Arabic is a cursive script,
          meaning its letters are typically joined together within a word.
          This creates additional challenges,
          as the usual method for stretching out text—<wbr/>
          inserting spaces between glyphs—<wbr/>
          does not work.</p>
        <p>Since Arabic uses spaces between words,
          one method for justification is inter-word justification—<wbr/>
          stretching out the spaces within the line to fill it.
          However, most styles of Arabic writing prefer calligraphic elongation or compression,
          distorting the shapes and connections between letters
          in order to fill the line while preserving its typographic color.
          This is often called “kashida”, meaning “stretched”.
          A simplistic variant of this technique inserts elongation marks
          (sometimes represented with U+0640 “ـ” TATWEEL)
          at appropriate points in the text.</p>
        <p>Syriac and Mongolian
          have properties similar to Arabic,
          and in the absence of additional information should be given
          similar treatment for justification.</p>

        <h3>Tibetan Writing System</h3>
        <p>Tibetan is a Brahmic writing system related to Indic scripts like Devanagari and Gujarati;
          however, unlike these systems, it does not use Western-style punctuation
          nor spaces between words,
          and instead uses the Tibetan Tsheg Mark U+0F0B “་”
          between syllables
          and its own punctuation marks such as the Tibetan Shad U+0F0D “།” and Tibetan Nyis Shad U+ 0F0E “༎”,
          which indicate the end of longer segments.</p>
        <p>Justification techniques used in Tibetan include stretching the space after a shad, minutely increasing the spaces after tsheg marks,
          and simply filling the remaining space on a line with tsheg marks.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="justification_sea">
        <h3>Southeast Asian Writing Systems</h3>
        <p>In Southeast Asian systems such as Thai and Lao,
          letters are merged together into “clusters”.
          There are no spaces between words
          (lines must be broken by dictionary),
          but spaces serve to separate larger units of text.</p>
        <p>Techniques for justification include stretching spaces on the line
          (if it happens to have any)
          and interspersing extra space between clusters.</p>
        <p>Scripts in this category include
          Khmer, Myanmar, Lao, and Thai.</p>

      <section id="justification_other">
        <h3> Other Writing Systems</h3>
        <p>Most (but not all) writing systems not mentioned here
          have discrete letters, like Latin,
          and in the absence of more specific information
          may be assumed to justify in a similar manner.</p>

      <h2>Advice for implementers and authors</h2>
      <p>In this section we provide additional advice for implementers related to justification.</p>
      <section id="tagging_by_script">
        <h3>Tagging Content By Writing System</h3>
<p>While most languages have a preferred writing system,
	many can be transcribed into a different system.
	As a common example, most languages have a Latin transcription,
	and can thus be written in the Latin writing system.
	In these cases the document typically adopts the typographic conventions of the Latin writing system:
	for example Japanese “romaji” and Chinese Pinyin use word spaces and justify accordingly.
	As another example, historical ideographic Korean
	(<code>ko-Hant</code>)
	does not use word spaces,
	and should therefore be justified as for Chinese.</p>
   <p>Authors can indicate the use of the Latin writing system
	with the <code>-Latn</code> language subtag,
	e.g. <code>ja-Latn</code> for Japanese romaji.
	Other subtags exist for other writing systems,
	see ????.
	Some common/historical examples follow:</p>
   <div class="example" id="example-95b4e286">
    <dl>
     <dt><code>zh-Latn</code> 
     </dt><dd>Chinese, written in Latin transcription 
     </dd><dt><code>ko-Hant</code> 
     </dt><dd>Korean, written in Hanja (Chinese ideographic characters) 
     </dd><dt><code>??-Arab</code> 
     </dt><dd>Turkish, written in Arabic script. 
     </dd><dt><code>??-???</code> 
     </dt><dd>Mongolian, written in Cyrillic 
     </dd><dt><code>??-???</code> 
     </dt><dd>Mongolian, written in traditional Mongolian script. 
    </dd></dl>
   </div>
   <p>UAs should assume the most common writing system for a given language
	when choosing a justification strategy,
	but must not assume that writing system
	if the author has explicitly indicated a different one.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="justification_untagged">
        <h3>Justifying Untagged Content</h3>
<p>Web browsers frequently have to deal with untagged, potentially mixed-script content.
	The following are some guidelines for designing a strategy to deal with such content.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Since Chinese and Japanese do not use spaces to provide justification opportunities,
		CJK content (Han, Hiragana, Katakana, and Hangul)
		should be allowed to accept inter-character spacing. 
    </li><li>Since Japanese content prefers compression,
		CJK fullwidth punctuation characters, if present on a line,
		should be compressed at a higher priority (if possible) than expanding spaces
		or letter-spacing. 
    </li><li>Since Korean prefers expanding spaces to expanding between characters,
		spaces should be expanded at a higher priority (if possible)
		than letter-spacing. 
   </li></ul>
    <p class="advisement"> Authors should use (correct) language tags
	in order to get the best possible typographic behavior.
	For example, if Japanese text is tagged as Japanese,
	the UA knows to preferentially compress the space rather than expand it.</p>
