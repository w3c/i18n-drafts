    Unicode-enabled software. A basic understanding of Unicode and the principles
    of character encoding is assumed. Some sources for information about these
    include: </p>

<section>
  <h2 id="why"><a href="#why">Why migrate to Unicode?</a></h2>
  <p>There are a number of reasons for adopting Unicode:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Text processing requires understanding the text being processed, and so
      depends on the character encoding. Unicode provides a solid foundation
      for processing all text worldwide, while non-Unicode encodings require
      separate implementations for each encoding and support only a limited set
      of languages each. Using Unicode consistently also makes it easier to
      share text processing software around the world. </li>
    <li>Some applications support communication and collaboration
      between users who live in different parts of the world and use different
      languages. Unicode is the standard that enables worldwide communication,
      without restrictions imposed by the language that the user uses or region
      that they live in. </li>
    <li>Because many languages are not supported by non-Unicode
      character encodings, users sometimes submit user-generated content (such
      as form data) in encodings other than the supported ones (e.g., by
      changing the browser encoding). This prevents the application from
      processing the text correctly, for example, when searching for it in the
      database, or when selecting ads to be placed next to it. </li>
    <li>Many Web site or application bugs are related to character
      encodings, because different sites or different localizations of the same
      site use different character encodings, and the encoding of text data is
      misinterpreted in many places. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that simply changing the character encoding of your pages to Unicode
    will not eliminate all character encoding problems. In fact, during the
    migration there is a significantly increased risk of such bugs, because
    existing data must be converted to Unicode, and the current encoding is not
    always known. This document provides tips on how to minimize this risk, and
    how to provide mechanisms to correct character conversion issues.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2 id="planning"><a href="#planning">Planning your migration</a></h2>
  <p>To scope the migration to Unicode, you need to understand the use of
    character encodings in your current setup and decide on the internal and
    external use of character encodings for the Unicode-based design. You also
    need to know the state of Unicode support in software components you rely on,
    and where needed, the migration plans for these components. This enables you
    to plan the upgrade of your software to be based on Unicode, and the
    conversion of existing data to Unicode encodings.</p>
  <p>A project to migrate to Unicode may also be a good time to improve
    internationalization in general. In particular, you should consider whether
    you can use the multilingual capabilities of Unicode to break down
    unnecessary barriers between different audiences, cultures, or languages.
    Especially for sites or applications that enable communication between users
    and thus host or transmit user-generated content, it may make sense to have a
    single worldwide site with shared multilingual content, despite having
    several localized user interfaces.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2 id="understanding"><a href="#understanding">Understanding the current use of character encodings</a></h2>
  <p>As a starting point, you need to thoroughly understand how character
    encodings are used in your current software. Identify the components of the
    software and the data containers: front end, back end, storage, APIs, web
    interfaces, and so on, and clarify their use of encodings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which components are Unicode-based already? Which Unicode encoding is
      used (UTF-8 or UTF-16)? Which components use legacy (that is,
      non-Unicode) encodings? </li>
    <li>What are the data flows between the components, and which encoding is
      used on each path?</li>
    <li>Which encodings are specified for the interfaces between
      components?</li>
    <li>Which encodings are specified for the external interfaces of the
      software?</li>
    <li>Where does encoding conversion occur?</li>
    <li>Are units of text that use different encodings clearly separated, and
      are the encodings specified at each point, or are there opportunities for
      text in different or unknown encodings to be stored or processed?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The last question may be surprising, but is particularly important. Lack
    of correct information about the character encoding used for text that is
    coming in from outside the site (such as content feeds or user input) or
    that's already in your data collections is a common problem, and needs
    particular attention. (Actually, you need to pay attention to such things
    even if you're not converting to Unicode.) There are variety of ways this
    lack of correct information may come about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data from the outside may not identify its character encoding at all.
      This is a very common problem for email, web pages, or data feeds.</li>
    <li>Data from the outside may incorrectly identify its character encoding.
      This is also a common problem for email and web pages.</li>
    <li>Web applications may have assumed a character encoding for form
      submissions, but users actually changed the encoding in the browser.
      Users commonly do this if the encoding used by the web application
      doesn't support the user's language, e.g., the application only supports
      ISO 8859-1, but the user wants to use a non-Latin script language, such
      as Greek, Russian, Hindi, Chinese, and so on.</li>
    <li>The encoding was known at some point, but then the information was
      stripped. This is a common situation with log files - the web application
      may have known (or at least correctly assumed) the character encoding
      used for an HTTP request, but the request itself and therefore the log
      record do not contain this information.</li>
    <li>Data was passed through an interface in one encoding where the
      interface actually requires a different encoding. An example would be
      storing user information encoded using UTF-8 in an ISO 8859-1
      database.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To deal with such situations, character encoding detection is commonly
    used. Encoding detection attempts to determine the encoding used in a byte
    sequence based on characteristics of the byte sequence itself. In most cases
    it's a statistical process that needs long input byte sequences to work well,
    although you may be able to improve its accuracy by using other information
    available to your application. Because of the high error rate, it's often
    necessary to provide ways for humans to discover and correct errors. This
    requires keeping the original byte sequence available for later reconversion.
    Examples of encoding detection libraries include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a
  class="print" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/chardet.html">Mozilla</a></li>
    <li><a
  class="print" href="http://icu-project.org/userguide/charsetDetection.html">ICU</a></li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section>
  <h2 id="checking"><a href="#checking">Checking the foundations</a></h2>
  <p>Software often depends on other software for its implementation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>programming languages and their associated libraries,</li>
    <li>database engines,</li>
    <li>software platforms or libraries your software is based on,</li>
    <li>other sites or applications your software interfaces with,</li>
    <li>third party libraries, </li>
    <li>tools you use to build, test, and deploy your software.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You need to check whether the software you depend on supports Unicode, or
    at least doesn't put obstacles into your adopting it. It will commonly be
    necessary to upgrade to newer versions of underlying platforms, and in a few
    cases it will be necessary to migrate from obsolete platforms to newer
    ones.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2 id="internal"><a href="#internal">Deciding on character encoding use for internal use</a></h2>
  <p>Unicode offers three encoding forms: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. For
    transportation over the network or for storage in files UTF-8 usually works
    the best because it is ASCII-compatible, while the ASCII-look-alike bytes
    contained in UTF-16 and UTF-32 text are a problem for some network
    devices or file processing tools. For in-memory processing, all three
    encoding forms can be useful, and the best choice often depends on the
    programming platforms and libraries you use: Java, JavaScript, ICU, and most
    Windows APIs are based on UTF-16, while Unix systems tend to prefer UTF-8.
    Storage size is rarely a factor in deciding between UTF-8 and UTF-16 because
    either one can have a better size profile, depending on the mix of markup and
    European or Asian languages. UTF-32 is inefficient for storage and therefore
    rarely used for that purpose, but it is very convenient for processing, and
    some libraries, such as Java and ICU, provide string accessors and processing
    API in terms of UTF-32 code points. Conversion between the three encoding
    forms is fast and safe, so it's quite feasible and common to use different
    encoding forms in different components of large software systems.</p>
  <p>Storage of text whose character encoding is not known with certainty is an
    exception from the Unicode-only rule. Such text often has to be interpreted
    using character encoding detection. And character encoding detection is not a
    reliable process. Thus, you should keep the original bytes around (along with
    the detected character encoding) so that the text can be reconverted if a
    human corrects the encoding selection.</p>

  <h2 id="externalif"><a href="#externalif">Deciding on character encoding use for external interfaces</a></h2>
  <p>For communicating with the world outside your application, UTF-8 should be
    used wherever possible. However, there are situations where you can't control
    the encoding, or need to communicate with systems that don't support UTF-8.
    Here are recommendations for common cases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong class="leadin">Email:</strong> You need to accept incoming
        email in whatever encoding it uses. For outgoing email, you might have to
        take into consideration that many older email applications don't support
        UTF-8. For the time being, outgoing email should therefore be converted
        to a legacy encoding that can represent its entire content; UTF-8 should
        only be used if no such legacy encoding can be found. The encoding of
        outgoing email must be specified. Selecting which outbound encodings to
        use will depend on your application's needs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong class="leadin">URIs and POST
        data:</strong> These are used in several different contexts: form
        submissions, web services, or URLs entered directly into a web browser.
        For form submissions, the HTML form should be designed to identify the
        character encoding even if the user changes it in the browser. (You can
        use JavaScript or special field values to determine if the user has
        changed the encoding: perhaps you should gently remind the user not to do
        that?)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong class="leadin">Web
        services:</strong> Web services (especially REST-based Web services)
        should specify the use of UTF-8 and reject requests that are not valid
        UTF-8. For third party web services, use UTF-8 if supported by the web
        service and ensure correct identification of the character encoding used.
        For URIs entered directly into a web browser (such as marketing URIs),
        other encodings may need to be supported.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong class="leadin">HTML:</strong> When serving pages to desktop browsers, use UTF-8; support for it is now
        almost universal. Mobile browsers don't always support UTF-8, so you may
        have to use a legacy encoding depending on the target device. The
        encoding used should be declared using the HTTP <code
    class="kw" translate="no">Content-Type</code> header, the HTML <code
    class="kw" translate="no">meta</code> tag, or (preferably) both. If you cannot control
        the configuration of your server on a file or request level or can't set
        it to send UTF-8 as the encoding, then least be sure that it does not
        send an encoding at all: user agents pay attention to this encoding
        before any declared in a meta tag. The correct HTML <code
    class="kw" translate="no">meta</code> tag is </p>
      <p><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8"&gt;</code></p>
      <p>How to set the HTTP <code
    class="kw" translate="no">Content-Type</code> header depends on your runtime
        environment. For example, in PHP, you'd use </p>
      <p><code>&lt;?php header("Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8"); ?&gt;</code>. </p>
      <p>See more information on <a 
    class="print" href="/International/O-HTTP-charset">setting the
        content-type</a>.</p>
      <p>If you take content from outside your site (such as
        when you spider for a search engine or include external HTML), you'll
        need to deal with whatever encoding that material is in. In some cases
        this means accepting and processing the encoding used. If you incorporate
        that material into your own pages, you'll need to make the encoding
        consistent with your page (or put it into an iframe where it can use its
        original encoding).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong
    class="leadin">XML:</strong>Outgoing XML should always be encoded in
        UTF-8; the <a class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charencoding">XML
        specification</a> requires every XML parser to understand it. For XML
        data sources, specify the use of UTF-8. In other cases, XML files in
        other encodings need to be accepted as long as they are valid.  Note that the HTTP Content-Type text/xml defaults to US-ASCII (for this reason, application/xml+* is usually preferred) and you'll still need to specify the charset if you use the text/xml Content-Type.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong class="leadin">JSON:</strong> Outgoing JSON data should always be encoded in UTF-8 and preferably in
        ASCII with \u escapes for all non-ASCII characters. For incoming data,
        support for UTF-16 and UTF-32 might also be considered. The <a
    class="print" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt">JSON specification</a> does
        not allow any other encodings.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong class="leadin">Serialized
        PHP:</strong> This data format should be avoided because it does not
        allow the specification of the encoding used, and is therefore likely to
        lead to data corruption for non-ASCII text. JSON is a good alternative.
        If you absolutely can't avoid serialized PHP, specify and use UTF-8.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong class="leadin">Other data
        feeds:</strong> Where you can influence the character encoding of
        incoming feeds, it should be UTF-8, or at least well-specified. There may
        be cases though where you want to use feeds that you can't control, in
        which case you have to use whatever you get.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Generally, incoming text should be converted to a Unicode encoding as soon
    as possible, and outgoing text, if it has to be sent in a non-Unicode
    encoding, converted from Unicode to that other encoding as late as possible.
    However, if the encoding of incoming text cannot be determined with
    certainty, then the original text must be stored along with information about
    the likely encoding. This enables corrective action if it turns out that the
    encoding was wrong.</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="roadmap"><a href="#roadmap">Creating a road map</a></h2>
  <p>For very simple sites or applications it may be possible to change the
    entire software to be based on Unicode, convert all data to a Unicode
    encoding, and switch over from the pre-Unicode version to the Unicode version
    in one instant. But many sites or applications offer external interfaces,
    have large bodies of code, and have accumulated huge data sets, so their
    conversion is a big project with multiple dependencies that needs to be
    carefully planned. Here's a breakdown into likely sub-projects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Specify the encoding used in existing APIs. As more and more components
      are going to use Unicode encodings, it is essential to know which
      components don't do so yet in order to avoid data corruption.</li>
    <li>Introduce Unicode-based versions of external interfaces
      that other software depends on. This should be the first step in order to
      enable the migration of the dependent software. In this step, every
      external interface (API, web service, data flow) that is based on legacy
      encodings is duplicated with a parallel Unicode-based interface. For many
      interfaces, the initial version of the new interface simply converts
      incoming text from Unicode to the legacy encoding that's still used,
      calls the old interface, and converts outgoing text from the legacy
      encoding to Unicode. In some cases, the new interface will be quite
      different from the old one: For example, where the old interface consists
      of direct access to shared data, the new interface needs to be an API
      (yes, data encapsulation is a good idea). The use of legacy encodings in
      the underlying implementation implies that only a subset of the Unicode
      character set is supported - this limitation should be documented and
      then removed by subsequent steps.</li>
    <li>Encourage the owners of other products that access your
      databases directly to migrate to the new API. You want to get this
      started early, because you can't convert your database to Unicode while
      others access it assuming legacy encodings.</li>
    <li>Introduce a Unicode-based data abstraction layer to the
      product's private databases. Similar to the step above, this enables the
      conversion of the implementation of your product to go ahead without
      waiting for the conversion of the databases.</li>
    <li>Convert the implementation of your product to Unicode. As
      part of this step, you'll change your external interfaces so that now the
      Unicode-based versions work directly with the implementation, while the
      versions based on legacy encodings convert to and from Unicode. For large
      sites or applications, this step may start by introducing Unicode-based
      internal interfaces between subsystems, similar to what you did for
      external interfaces above, so that the subsystems can be converted
      independently.</li>
    <li>
      <p>Convert your databases and/or data stores
        to Unicode. If the databases were accessed directly by other products,
        this may have to wait until those products have migrated to the APIs
        introduced in the first step. The section <a
    href="#migratingdata">Migrating Data</a> has more information on this
        step.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Remove interfaces that are based on legacy encodings. This
      will be the final step of your migration, and, depending on who relies on
      these interfaces, may have to wait for a long time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some of these sub-projects can be executed in parallel or in a different
    order, depending on the specific situation of your product. For example,
    migration of the implementation of your product may be held up by
    dependencies on other software components that haven't sufficiently
    progressed in their migration yet. On the other hand, SQL databases can be
    migrated to Unicode much earlier because the client component of the database
    software insulates clients from the encoding used in the database and
    performs character encoding conversion when necessary. Migrating databases
    early on has benefits: It simplifies testing, because the database can be
    tested independently from the software using it, while testing higher-level
    software typically requires a database, and it may allow you to merge
    multiple separate databases using legacy encodings into a single multilingual
    database.</p>

  <h2 id="designing"><a href="#designing">Designing for Unicode</a></h2>

    <section>
      <h3 id="encodingspecs"><a href="#encodingspecs">Character encoding specifications</a></h3>
    <p>Byte sequences can only be correctly interpreted as text if the character
      encoding is known. Many applications are written such that they just move
      around byte sequences, without naming the character encoding. As discussed
      above, this has always caused problems. But it happened to work in many cases
      in which users all speak the same language or are willing to adapt to some
      content being incorrectly rendered on the page. During the transition to
      Unicode, however, each language will be handled in at least two encodings,
      the legacy encoding for that language and UTF-8, so specifying the encoding
      for each byte sequence will be critical in order to avoid an avalanche of
      data corruption bugs.</p>
    <p>Character encodings can be specified in a variety of ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In the format specification: The specification for a
          data format may specify either the character encoding directly or a
          simple deterministic mechanism for detecting the character encoding by
          looking at the beginning of a byte sequence. Examples are the
          specification of the <a
    class="print" href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">Java
          String class</a>, which specifies UTF-16, and the <a
    class="print" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt">JSON specification</a>, which
          prescribes the use of Unicode encodings and how to distinguish between
          them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As part of the byte sequence: The
          specification for a data format may provide for a mechanism to specify
          the character encoding as part of the byte sequence. The XML
          specification does so in an elegant way using the <a 
    class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-20060816/#charencoding">encoding
          declaration</a>, the HTML specification in a less elegant way using the <code class="kw" translate="no"><a
    class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/charset.html#h-5.2.2">meta</a></code> tag. For data formats that allow such specification, the data can contain
          the encoding specification unless the byte sequence is in UTF-8 and the
          specification ensures correct detection of UTF-8 (as for XML). For HTML
          files, the <code class="kw" translate="no">meta</code> tag specifying the content type
          and character encoding should be the first sub-element of the <code
    class="kw" translate="no">head</code> element, and it must not be preceded by non-ASCII
          characters.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In data external to the byte sequence:
          In many cases, a container of the byte sequence provides the encoding
          specification. Some examples would include HTTP or MIME, where the <code class="kw" translate="no"><a
    class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17">Content-Type</a></code> header field can specify the character encoding, and databases, where
          the encoding is specified as part of the schema or the database
          configuration. Again, where such capabilities exist, textual data should
          make use of it. In some cases, such as sending HTML over HTTP, the
          external encoding specification may duplicate one that's part of the byte
          sequence - that's a good thing, because the HTTP header is preferred by
          browsers, while the <code class="kw" translate="no">meta</code> tag is the only
          specification that survives if the file is saved to disk.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In interface specifications: Specifications of interfaces
          that accept or return byte sequences without any of the character
          encoding specifications above can (and should) specify the character
          encoding used. The specification may be absolute or relative to an
          environment setting. For example, some libraries provide functions that
          accept or return strings in UTF-8, while others accept or return strings
          encoded in some legacy encoding.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By context: The character encoding may
          be derived from the context in which the byte sequence occurs. For
          example, browsers generally send form data in the character encoding of
          the web page that contains the form. This is a very weak form of
          specification because the byte sequence often is transferred out of the
          context, such as into log files, where the encoding can no longer be
          reconstructed. Also, users sometimes change the browser encoding so that
          the encoding of the returned form data no longer matches the encoding of
          the page that the web application generated. Using UTF-8 is one way to
          minimize the damage resulting from this weak form of encoding
          specification because it eliminates the need for users to change the
          browser encoding and because character encoding detection works better
          for UTF-8 than for most other encodings. </p>
      </li>
      <li>By an external agreement: Where none of the above applies,
        such as plain text files, an external agreement must be made about the
        encoding. Such an agreement might, for example, be part of the license
        agreement for a content feed.The first four mechanisms are better than
        the last two and should be preferred wherever possible. Any of them is
        better than not specifying the encoding at all.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3 id="encodingnames"><a href="#encodingnames">Character Encoding Names</a></h3>
    <p>There is a standard for naming character encodings on the internet, <a
class="print" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2978.txt">RFC 2978</a>, and an associated <a
class="print" href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets">IANA charset
      registry</a>. However, actual use is often different. Many encodings come in
      different variants or have siblings supporting extended character sets, and
      different software often uses different names for the same encoding or the
      same name for different encodings. For example, the name ISO-8859-1 is often used to describe data that actually uses the encoding windows-1252. This latter encoding (Microsoft Windows code page 1252) is very similar to ISO 8859-1 but assigns graphic characters to the range of bytes between  0x80 and 0x9F. Many Web applications (such as browsers, search engines, etc.) treat content bearing the ISO 8859-1 label as using the windows-1252 encoding instead, since, for all practical purposes, windows-1252 is a &quot;superset&quot; of ISO 8859-1. Other applications, such as encoding converters (like iconv or ICU) are pretty literal, and you must specify the right encoding name in order to get the proper results.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="determination"><a href="#determination">Character Encoding Determination</a></h3>
    <p>Whenever a byte sequence is interpreted as text and processed, its
      character encoding must be known. In many cases determining the character
      encoding is so trivial that it's not even thought about - for example, when
      processing a string in a programming language that specifies that strings are
      encoded in UTF-16. However, in other cases, no clear specification of the
      character encoding is available, or the text comes from a source that may not
      be fully trusted to provide a correct specification. In such cases, a more
      complicated process is necessary to determine the character encoding and to
      enable later correction of mistakes made:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interpret any available character encoding specification. If a
        specification is available and can be trusted, you're done.</li>
      <li>If a character encoding specification is available, but
        can't be fully trusted, validate it. Validation is possible for encodings
        that impose restrictions on valid byte sequences, such as UTF-8, EUC-KR,
        ISO 2022-JP. If the text is converted to a different encoding for
        internal processing, validation is often just a side effect of
        conversion, but if no conversion is necessary, validation is still
        required. If the byte sequence is invalid for the specified encoding, you
        should reject the input and get the provider to produce correct input (in
        the case of XML, rejection is required by the specification). However, in
        cases where you have no control over the data, we move on to the next
        step.</li>
      <li>If no character encoding specification is available, or
        validation failed, use character encoding detection to detect the likely
        encoding.</li>
      <li>If the character encoding was determined through detection
        (rather than specification and validation), keep the original byte
        sequence around so that it can be reconverted in a different character
        encoding later on. Provide a user interface mechanism that lets users
        override the specified or detected character encoding and redo
        conversion. Store the most recently used character encoding for the byte
        sequence along with the byte sequence, especially if the user selected
        it, so as to avoid unnecessarily redoing all the steps above.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="selection"><a href="#selection">Character Encoding Selection and Declaration</a></h3>
    <p>When sending text, the appropriate character encoding needs to be selected based on the data format and the recipient. The section <a href="#externalif">Deciding on Character Encoding Use for External Interfaces</a> discusses encoding use based on data formats. In most cases, a Unicode encoding is recommended. However, there are two major exceptions: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><em>Email</em>: Many older email applications don't support UTF-8. For the time being, email should therefore be converted to a legacy encoding that can represent its entire content; UTF-8 should only be used if no such legacy encoding can be found.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Mobile browsers</em>: Mobile systems don't always support UTF-8. It may therefore be necessary to select other encodings based on the specific device. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>No matter which encoding is used, the character encoding really must be unambiguously specified using one of the mechanisms described in the <a href="#encodingspecs">Character Encoding Specifications</a> section. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="ceconversion"><a href="#ceconversion">Character Encoding Conversion</a></h3>
    <p>Whenever text is expected to be in one character encoding in one place and in a different character encoding in the next place, encoding conversion is necessary. Some commonly used libraries for character encoding conversion are ICU and iconv, however, some platforms, such as Java and Perl, bring along their own conversion libraries.</p>
    <p>When using the libraries, it is important to use the right encoding names for the specific library. See the section <a href="#encodingnames">Character Encoding Names</a> above for more information.</p>
    <p>There are some specific conversion issues that may affect particular
      products:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Alternative mappings for certain characters: In some East Asian
        encodings, a few characters have multiple interpretations. For example,
        the value 0x5C in Shift-JIS may be interpreted as "\" in file names, but
        as "¥" in financial data. When mapping to Unicode, a decision has to be
        made whether to map to U+005C "\" or to U+00A5 "¥". A common approach is
        to map to U+005C, which works for the file system and which many Japanese
        fonts will display as "¥". However, if the behavior of your application
        could depend on the mapping (e.g., it parses currency values), you have
        to take the necessary steps to control the outcome. In the example case,
        you might map 0x5C to the currency code "JPY" before the conversion and
        then "JPY" to U+00A5 after conversion.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Private use characters: Several
          character encodings, including Unicode and most East Asian encodings,
          have code point ranges that are reserved for private use or just
          undefined. These are often used for company specific or personal use
          characters — the <a class="print" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji">emoji</a> defined by Japanese mobile operators are an example. Standard character
          converters don't know how to map such characters. For applications where
          support for private use characters is critical, you either have to use
          custom character converters or use workarounds such as numeric character
          references to ensure correct mapping.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Versions of character encodings and
          mappings: Many character encodings evolve over time, and so do the
          mappings between them. An example is the mapping from <a
    class="print" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKSCS">HKSCS</a> to Unicode: Early
          versions of HKSCS had to map numerous characters into the Unicode private
          use area because Unicode didn't support the characters, but later these
          characters were added to the Unicode character repertoire, and the
          mappings from HKSCS were changed to map to the newly added characters. In
          general, you should make sure you're using the latest versions of the
          character converters.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="normalization"><a href="#normalization">Normalization</a></h3>
    <p>Some characters have more than one way of being represented in Unicode.
      Unicode defines several ways of eliminating these differences when they do
      not matter to text processing. For more information on Normalization, see <a
class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod-norm">CharMod-Norm</a>. </p>
    <p>Unicode does not prescribe when to use a specific Unicode normalization
      form. However, a number of processes work better if text is normalized, in
      particular processes involving text comparison such as collation, search, and
      regular expression processing. Some libraries performing these processes
      offer normalization as part of the process; otherwise, you should ensure that
      text is normalized before using these processes. Generally, normalization
      form C (NFC) is recommended for web applications. However, some processes,
      such as internationalized domain names, use other normalization forms.</p>
    <p>Some languages will require normalization before processing since
      different input methods may generate different sequences of Unicode
      codepoints. Vietnamese is a prime example where the Vietnamese keyboard
      layout in Windows 2000 onwards produces a different character sequence than
      most other third party Vietnamese input software does. Similar issues arise
      in a number of African languages, Yoruba being the first that comes to
      mind.</p>

      <h3 id="textsize"><a href="#textsize">Text Size Issues</a></h3>
    <p>Storing text as Unicode often takes more space than storing it in legacy
      encodings. The exact amount of expansion depends on the  language and particular text involved. Expansions for some common encodings might be as much as:</p>

    </table>
    <p>At a macro level, this doesn't really matter much. Network bandwidth and
      storage nowadays are dominated by videos, images, and sound files, while text
      only consumes a fraction. There may be an impact on storage systems that
      store only text. If text size is really a concern, it can be reduced using
      compression.</p>
    <p>At the micro level, however, the increased storage size has a number of
      implications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Algorithms that were designed under the assumption of one character,
        one byte, don't work anymore even for European languages (they never
        worked for East Asian languages). They need to be changed to accommodate
        multi-byte character representations. Make sure that all processing
        always operates on complete characters. A complete character can take
        between one and four bytes in UTF-8, and either one or two 16-bit code
        units in UTF-16. For character positions, always use the index of the
        first byte or code unit of the character.</li>
      <li>In particular, any length specifications need to be
        reviewed to see whether they should be based on bytes, characters, UTF-16
        code units, or glyphs. Each basis makes sense in some situations, but it
        needs to be clear which one applies. Using a character-based definition
        will guarantee enough space, but may consume more storage than is
        strictly necessary because each character now requires 4 bytes. Using a
        byte-based definition avoids this size expansion, but may restrict the
        number of characters too much. Best of course are schemes that allocate
        just enough space to hold the given text. Other space-driven applications
        (such as number of "characters" that can be displayed in a form field)
        may have nothing to do with the number of logical characters and instead
        need to count the number visual text units (called graphemes).</li>
      <li>Text size changes whenever text is converted from one
        encoding to another. There are no fixed multipliers that can be applied
        to estimate the needed storage size, so the only way to find out is to
        actually convert the text. Care must be taken to avoid truncation. If
        truncation is absolutely required, as in some display contexts, care must
        be taken to truncate on character or grapheme boundaries.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3 id="libraries"><a href="#libraries">Using libraries</a></h3>
    <p>To work with Unicode, it is often advantageous to use software libraries
      that are dedicated to Unicode support. Older libraries may support Unicode
      less well, or not at all.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="language"><a href="#language">Language determination and declaration</a></h3>
    <p>While Unicode enables multilingual applications and documents, there are
      many processes that require knowledge about the actual language in use. Such
      processes range from simple case-folding to searching and spelling
      checking.</p>
    <p>Unicode-based APIs should therefore enable the specification of the
      language(s) used wherever such knowledge may be needed, and the language of
      user-generated content should be recorded where possible. Where the language
      cannot be captured at the source, a language detection library may be
      useful.</p>
    <p>To help other applications, the language of web content, where known,
      should be declared using the HTTP <code class="kw" translate="no">Content-Language</code> header or the HTML/XML <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> attributes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="fonts"><a href="#fonts">Font issues</a></h3>
    <p>Web sites using Unicode need to be more careful about specifying fonts
      than web sites using legacy encodings. Many languages have unique or specific
      writing traditions, even though they share a script with other languages. In
      other cases, fonts support can be a barrier because the fonts necessary to
      display specific scripts are not installed on most systems.</p>
    <p>For example, the Chinese and Japanese writing systems share a large number
      of characters, but have different typographic traditions, so that Chinese
      fonts are generally not acceptable for Japanese text and vice versa. For
      example, here is the same character being displayed using a Chinese and a
      Japanese font (along with the HTML code used to generate the screen
      capture):</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p><img src="index-data/zhs-jpn-font.jpg" height="53" width="105"
alt="Picture of the same Unicode ideographic character, but with two different glyph representations."
/></p>
      <p><code>&lt;span style="font-size:3em;font-family:sans-serif;"&gt;<br />
        &lt;span lang="zh-Hans-CN" style="font-family: simsun, hei,
        sans-serif;"&gt;直&lt;/span&gt;<br />
        &lt;span lang="ja" style="font-family: 'ms gothic',
        osaka;"&gt;直&lt;/span&gt;<br />
        &lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
    </div>
    <p>When legacy encodings are used, browsers often guess the language from the
      encoding and pick an appropriate font.</p>
    <p>Since Unicode supports both Chinese and Japanese, this trick doesn't work
      for Unicode-encoded pages, and the result can be an inappropriate font or
      even an ugly mix of fonts being used to render the content.</p>
    <p>One solution is to keep track of the language in use, and
      communicate both the language and the preferred fonts for the language to the
      browser. For monolingual pages, using a language specific style sheet is a
      simple and effective approach. For multilingual pages, you should use the <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> attribute on HTML tags to identify the language; a few browsers
      use this information as guidance in selecting the right font. For precise
      control over the font you can also use classes to identify the language and
      class selectors in the style sheet to set the font. The CSS 2.1 language
      pseudo class selectors, which would select directly based on language
      attribute(s), isn't supported by Internet Explorer and so is of limited
      usefulness. See <a

<section>
  <h2 id="migrating"><a href="#migrating">Migrating Data</a></h2>
  <p>Converting the data associated with a product will in many cases be the
    biggest challenge in migrating the product to Unicode. For example, some
    applications own or access a number of databases, some of which are managed
    by database engines such as Oracle or MySQL. Others use custom file formats
    and access mechanisms. These databases, regardless of type, need to be
    migrated to support Unicode.</p>
  <p>Migration of the data to Unicode is also a good time to consider
    consolidating databases that were previously separate because of different
    character encodings. Using a single database worldwide or just a few for the
    main regions may simplify deployment and maintenance, and may enable content
    sharing between different markets, and Unicode is ideal for this because it
    can represent text in all languages. Consolidation will however have to keep
    in mind that other restrictions on content sharing may remain - such as
    language availability, licensing conditions, and legal or cultural
    restrictions on publishing material related to politics, religion, sex, and
    violence.</p>
  <p>Strategies for conversion of the data will vary based on a number of
    factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether the data in a database all uses the same encoding or different
      encodings.</li>
    <li>Whether the encoding of the data is known with certainty or not.</li>
    <li>Whether data access or other functions implemented within the database
      depend on knowledge about the character encoding or not. For example,
      indices on text fields generally depend on the character encoding and
      language, while indices on numeric fields don't.</li>
    <li>Size of the data.</li>
    <li>Replication of the data.</li>
    <li>Uptime requirements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Because of variations in these factors, there's no simple recipe that can
    be followed in converting the databases of a product. The following is a
    discussion of common considerations; however, it will generally be necessary
    to create a tailored conversion plan for each product. Such a plan will
    likely have several phases for analysis, conversion with checking of the
    conversion results, and recovery if something goes wrong.</p>

    <section>
      <h3 id="sizeissues"><a href="#sizeissues">Dealing with text size issues</a></h3>
    <p>As mentioned in <a href="#textsize">Text Size Issues</a> (above),
      converting text to Unicode generally results in expanded storage
      requirements, and you need to carefully consider whether to measure text
      lengths in bytes, characters, or UTF-16 code units.To reduce the impact of
      increased field sizes, it may make sense to switch CHAR fields in SQL
      databases to VARCHAR, thus allowing the database to allocate just as much
      space as needed.</p>
    <p>On text measurement, some databases don't give you a choice. For example,
      MySQL always measures in terms of Unicode BMP characters, resulting in 3
      bytes per character. Others, such as Oracle, let you choose between character
      or byte semantics. Other storage systems that impose size limits are likely
      to measure in bytes.</p>
    <p>During the migration, which involves encoding conversion, be careful to
      avoid truncation. In some cases, unfortunately, you may not be able to do so
      because of external constraints, such as Oracle's limit of 30 bytes for
      schema object names in data dictionaries (use of ASCII characters for schema
      names helps avoid this issue). In such cases, at least make sure to truncate
      at a character boundary.</p>

      <h3 id="asciidata"><a href="#asciidata">Identifying ASCII data</a></h3>
    <p>It is worthwhile identifying data sets (files, database tables, database
      columns) that are entirely in ASCII. If the desired Unicode encoding is
      UTF-8, no conversion is necessary for such data sets because ASCII byte
      sequences are identical to the corresponding UTF-8 byte sequences. Also,
      indices over ASCII text fields are also valid for the corresponding UTF-8 or
      UTF-16 text fields, unless they are based on language sensitive sort orders.
      However, you have to be strict in identifying ASCII data sets. The term
      "ASCII" is often mistakenly used for things that aren't ASCII, such as plain
      text (in any encoding) or for text in the ISO 8859-1 or Windows-1252
      encodings. In addition, a number of character encodings have been designed to fit into
      7-bit byte sequences while representing completely different character sets
      from ASCII.</p>
    <p>To verify that the data set is indeed in ASCII, check for the
      following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All byte values within the data set are in the range 0x00 to 0x7F.
        ASCII does not use byte values above 0x7F.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The byte values 0x0E, 0x0F, and 0x1B are not used.
          The presence of these byte values is likely to indicate that the data is
          really in some <a class="print" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_2022">ISO-2022
          encoding</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the characters "+" and "-" occur, the intervening
          bytes are not valid BASE-64. If they are, the text is possible that they
          are in the <a class="print" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-7">UTF-7
          encoding</a>. Note that UTF-7 should be avoided wherever possible because
          of the potential for XSS attacks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The character sequences "~{" and "~}" don't occur.
          If they do, the text is likely to be in <a
    class="print" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HZ_%28character_encoding%29">HZ
          encoding</a>.</p>
      </li>

      <h3 id="uncertainty"><a href="#uncertainty">Dealing with uncertainty</a></h3>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, it sometimes occurs that databases contain text
      whose encoding isn't known. Character encoding detection can be used to get
      an idea of the encoding, but this process is not reliable. To deal with the
      uncertainty, a number of additional steps may be necessary:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Perform a trial to assess the accuracy of the encoding detection. Use
        the detection algorithm you intend to use on a subset of the data,
        convert the data from the detected encoding to Unicode, and have people
        familiar with the languages used verify the results. If the accuracy
        doesn't meet requirements, try other encoding detection algorithms or use
        additional information available to your application.</li>
      <li>If your data has associated encoding information (but you
        don't fully trust it), focus on cases where the detection algorithm
        detects a different encoding. This may help you zero in on necessary
        improvements in the use of additional information.</li>
      <li>After migration, provide ways to correct the encoding later
        on. One solution is to provide a user interface that lets the user
        indicate the actual encoding, which is then stored with the text and used
        to reconvert the text. To do this, you'll need to keep the original byte
        sequences available, along with the name of the detected encoding.
        Whether to also store a Unicode version of the text depends on how often
        the text is accessed - for text that is accessed often, it may be
        worthwhile caching the Unicode version, while for other text it may be
        better to save the storage and regenerate the Unicode version on the fly
        when needed. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For simplicity, the following sections assume that the encoding can be
      determined with certainty and conversion therefore is a one-time event. Where
      this is not the case, strategies need to be adjusted.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="ncrs"><a href="#ncrs">Making sense of Numeric Character References</a></h3>
    <p>Databases holding user-generated content often contain numeric character
      references (NCRs) for non-ASCII characters that users have entered, such as
      "&amp;#x0152;" (Œ) or &quot;&amp;#x20AC;&quot; (€). Many browsers generate the NCRs when
      users enter text into form fields that cannot be expressed in the form's
      character encoding. NCRs work fine if the text is subsequently redisplayed in
      HTML. They do not work, however, for other processes because they don't match
      the text they represent in searching, they get sorted in the wrong place, or
      they're ignored by case conversion. Migration to Unicode is therefore also a
      good time to convert NCRs to the corresponding Unicode characters. You'll
      need to be careful however to avoid conversions that change the meaning of
      the text (as might a conversion of "&amp;amp;" to "&amp;") or conversion to
      text that would have been filtered out for security reasons.</p>

    <section>
      <h3 id="bom"><a href="#bom">Using the BOM</a></h3>
    <p>During the migration from legacy encodings to Unicode, it's common to use
      legacy encodings and Unicode in parallel, and you need to be able to
      distinguish between them. In the general case, this requires character
      encoding specifications. However, if you need to distinguish between just one
      specific legacy encoding (such as the site's old default encoding) and UTF-8,
      you might use the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) as a prefix to identify UTF-8
      strings. This is particularly handy if there is no provision for a character
      encoding specification, for example in plain text files or in cookies. The
      BOM in UTF-8 is the byte sequence 0xEF 0xBB 0xBF, which is very unlikely to
      be meaningful in any legacy encoding.</p>
    <p>A reader for data that identifies its encoding in this way reads the first
      three bytes to determine the encoding. If the bytes match the BOM, the three
      bytes are stripped off and the remaining content returned as UTF-8. If they
      don't, the entire content is converted from the legacy encoding to UTF-8. This stripping, however, isn't automatic and it interferes with some platforms or languages. For example, a PHP file that starts with a BOM won't be interpreted properly by the PHP processor. So this trick is  best confined to well-known parts of your site or code.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="plaintext"><a href="#plaintext">Converting plain text files</a></h3>
    <p>Plain text files that use a single character encoding are easy to convert.
      For example, the iconv tool is available on most Unix/Linux systems. On
      systems that don't have it, a convenient approach is to install a Java
      Development Kit and use its native2ascii tool:</p>
    <div class="example"> <code>native2ascii -encoding _''sourceencoding'' ''sourcefile'' |
      native2ascii -reverse -encoding ''targetencoding'' &gt;
      ''targetfile''</code></div>
    <p>For small numbers of files, editors can also be used: TextPad on Windows,
      TextEdit on Mac, or jEdit on any platform are just a few editors that can
      convert files. Note that some editors, such as Notepad, like to prefix
      Unicode files with a Unicode byte-order mark (BOM), which in the case of
      UTF-8 files is unnecessary and may cause problems with software reading the
      files.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="structured"><a href="#structured">Converting structured files</a></h3>
    <p>Structured files in this context means any files, other than SQL
      databases, that have components that might have different encodings or that
      have length limitations. Examples are: log files, where different entries may
      use different encodings; email messages, where different headers and MIME
      body components may use different encodings, and the headers have length
      limitations; and cookies, which are often treated as having multiple fields.
      For such files, every component has to be converted separately, and length
      limitations have to be dealt with separately for each component.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="sql"><a href="#sql">Converting SQL databases</a></h3>
    <p>An SQL database really consists of two components: A server component,
      which actually manages the data, and a client component, which interfaces
      with other software (such as a PHP or Java runtime) and communicates with the
      server components. The character encoding that the client uses to communicate
      with the server can be set separately from the character encodings used by
      the server; the server will convert if necessary.</p>
    <p>Depending on the size of a database and its uptime requirements, various
      strategies for conversion are possible:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dump and reload: The contents of the database are dumped into a text
        file, converted to the desired Unicode encoding, and loaded into a new
        database. This strategy is simple, but only works for databases that can
        be taken offline for the extended period needed for conversion.</li>
      <li>Create new Unicode database: A new database using a Unicode
        encoding is created and content from the old database is copied over,
        doing conversion on the way. Transactions that update or delete already
        copied content need to be mirrored to the new database. When the new
        database has caught up to the old one, access is switched over to the new
        database. This is generally the best strategy for production databases,
        but it requires that enough database server hardware is available to run
        two databases in parallel.</li>
      <li>Add Unicode columns: In this model, each text column in a
        legacy encoding is paired with a new column in a Unicode encoding. Fields
        in this column are populated, and then queries are changed to access the
        Unicode column instead of the legacy encoding column. If the legacy
        encoding was known with certainty, the legacy encoding column can be
        deleted. This strategy may be necessary if not enough disk space is
        available to create a completely new database and if the code accessing
        the database is reasonably small.</li>
      <li>Convert in place: Some databases, such as MySQL, have the
        capability to convert a table in place from one encoding to another. This
        only works for databases that can be taken offline for the period needed
        for the conversion.</li>
      <li>Convert in place with encoding tag: If the database just
        manages bytes, and all interpretation of the bytes as text is done
        outside the database, it's possible to do the conversion in place and
        keep track of the progress using an encoding tag per record. Processes
        accessing the database need to be aware of the encoding tag and convert
        the bytes they store into or retrieve from the database from and to their
        own encodings. If the database only contains a single legacy encoding,
        the BOM can be used to distinguish Unicode strings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The SQL language and documentation have the unfortunate habit of using the
      term "character set" for character encodings, ignoring the fact that UTF-8
      and UTF-16 (and even GB18030) are different encodings of the same character
      set.</p>
    <div class="h4">
      <h4 id="oracle"><a href="#oracle">Oracle specifics</a></h4>
      <p>Oracle has general Unicode support starting with version
        8, but support for supplementary characters is only available starting with
        version 9r2, and support for Unicode 3.2 only starting with version 10. Also,
        the use of the <code class="kw" translate="no">NCHAR</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">NVARCHAR</code> data types before version 9 is somewhat
        difficult. Oracle provides comprehensive Globalization Support Guides for
        versions <a

        The chapters on Character Set Migration and Character Set Scanner are
        particularly relevant.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The character encoding selected for an Oracle database is set for the
      entire database, including data, schema, and queries, with one exception: The <code class="kw" translate="no">NCHAR</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">NVARCHAR</code> types
      always use Unicode. Different Unicode encodings are offered for the database
      as a whole and the <code class="kw" translate="no">NCHAR</code> and <code
class="kw" translate="no">NVARCHAR</code> data types. For the database, there are correct
      UTF-8 under the name <code class="kw" translate="no">AL32UTF8</code>, and a variant <code
class="kw" translate="no">UTF8</code> that encodes supplementary characters as two 3-byte
      sequences. For databases migrating to Unicode, you should use <code
class="kw" translate="no">AL32UTF8</code> (databases that already use <code
class="kw" translate="no">UTF8</code> can in most cases continue to do so - the difference
      between these encodings may affect collation and indexing within the
      database, but in general it doesn't matter much since the client interface
      converts <code class="kw" translate="no">UTF8</code> to correct UTF-8). For the <code
class="kw" translate="no">NCHAR</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">NVARCHAR</code> data types,
      UTF-16 is available under the name <code class="kw" translate="no">AL32UTF8</code>, along
      with the variant <code class="kw" translate="no">UTF8</code> encoding. The semantics of
      length specifications for the <code class="kw" translate="no">CHAR</code>, <code
class="kw" translate="no">VARCHAR2</code>, and <code class="kw" translate="no">LONG</code> data types can
      be set using the <code class="kw" translate="no">NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS</code>, with byte
      semantics as the default, while the <code class="kw" translate="no">NCHAR</code> and <code
class="kw" translate="no">NVARCHAR</code> data types always use character semantics.</p>
    <p>For correct conversion between the encoding(s) used within the database to
      the client's encoding it is essential to define the <code
class="kw" translate="no">NLS_LANG</code> environment variable on the client side. This
      variable describes the language, territory, and encoding used by the client
      OS. Oracle has numerous other settings to specify locale-sensitive behavior
      in the database; these can generally be set separately from the encoding as
      long as the encoding can represent the characters of the selected locale.
      Unicode supports all locales.</p>
    <p>Oracle provides built-in support for several conversion strategies. The
      Character Set Scanner tool helps in identifying possible conversion and
      truncation problems in the pre-conversion analysis. The Export and Import
      utilities help in implementing a dump and reload strategy. Adding Unicode
      columns is easy because the <code class="kw" translate="no">NCHAR</code> and <code
class="kw" translate="no">NVARCHAR</code> data types support Unicode independent of the
      database encoding. Converting in place with an encoding tag is possible if
      the database itself doesn't interpret the text - the <code class="kw" translate="no">ALTER
      DATABASE CHARSET</code> statement can be used to inform the database of the
      actual encoding once conversion has completed.</p>
    <p>There are reports that the <code class="kw" translate="no">NCHAR</code> data types are <a
class="print" href="http://download-west.oracle.com/otndocs/tech/ias/portal/files/RG/complete_web_site_php_faq2.htm#nchar">not
      supported</a> in the PHP Oracle Call Interface.</p>
    <div class="h4">
      <h4 id="mysql"><a href="#mysql">MySQL specifics</a></h4>
      <p>To get Unicode support in MySQL databases, you'll need to
        use MySQL 4.1 or higher. For information on upgrading to this version and on
        possible compatibility issues, see <a 
class="print" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/charset-upgrading.html">Upgrading
        Character Sets from MySQL 4.0</a>. For detailed information on character
        encoding support in MySQL, see the <a 
class="print" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/charset.html">Character Set
        Support</a> chapter of the MySQL documentation. The character encoding for
        the <a 
class="print" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/charset-syntax.html">database
        content</a> can be set separately at the server, database, table, or column
        level. Where the encoding isn't set explicitly, it's inherited from the next
        higher level.</p>
    </div>
    <p>MySQL's default encoding is <code class="kw" translate="no">latin1</code>, that is, ISO-8859-1. The supported
      Unicode encodings are called <code class="kw" translate="no">utf8</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">ucs2</code>. Usually the recommended character
      encoding for MySQL should be <code class="kw" translate="no">utf8</code>. Both <code class="kw" translate="no">utf8</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">ucs2</code> are limited to the
      characters of the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), so there's no
      support for supplementary characters in MySQL. As a result, <code class="kw" translate="no">utf8</code> isn't a
      wholly compliant implementation of UTF-8 (although for most purposes it is
      fine). The <code class="kw" translate="no">NCHAR</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">NVARCHAR</code> data types always use <code class="kw" translate="no">utf8</code>.</p>
    <p>Length specifications for character data types are
      interpreted to be in Unicode BMP characters, so a specification <code>CHAR(5) CHARACTER SET utf8</code> will reserve 15 bytes. Metadata,
      such as user names, is always stored in UTF-8, so non-Latin names can be
      used. The character encoding for the <a 
class="print" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/charset-connection.html">client
      connection</a> can be set separately for client, connection, and results, but
      to avoid confusion, it's best to set them all together using <code>SET NAMES 'utf8'</code>. The <code class="kw" translate="no">ucs2</code> encoding is not
      supported for the client connection, so there's no good reason to use this
      encoding for the database content either.</p>
    <p>Collations are related to character encodings, so they
      should always be set at the same time as the encoding. If <code class="kw" translate="no">utf8</code> is
      used without specifying a collation, the default collation <code
class="kw" translate="no">utf8_general_ci</code> is used. This is a legacy collation
      algorithm that's not good for any particular language. The collation <code
class="kw" translate="no">utf8_unicode_ci</code> is a better default, since it implements
      the Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) and works for many languages that are
      not specifically supported by a named collation. You can also select one of
      the language-named UTF-8 collations to get language-specific collation
      "tailoring" based on UCA. See the list of collations for <a 
class="print" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/charset-unicode-sets.html">Unicode
      Character Sets</a>. MySQL supports the <a 
class="print" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/charset-convert.html">CONVERT
      function</a>, which allows the results of a query to be converted from one
      encoding to another. MySQL also supports in-place conversion from one
      encoding to another using the <a 
class="print" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/alter-table.html">ALTER
      statement</a>: <code>ALTER TABLE table CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET
      utf8 COLLATE collation;</code>.</p>
    <div class="sidenoteGroup">
      <p>In some cases, the encoding of a column may be incorrectly
        declared in the schema - for example, UTF-8 data may have been stored in a
        MySQL database under the encoding name <code class="kw" translate="no">latin1</code> before MySQL really supported
        UTF-8, or Japanese data may have been labeled <code class="kw" translate="no">sjis</code> when it was actually
        using the Windows version of Shift-JIS, which MySQL calls <code class="kw" translate="no">cp932</code> (see <a

class="print" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/charset-cp932.html">The cp932
        Character Set</a> for more information on this case). In such cases, a column
        can be relabeled without conversion by changing its type to the binary
        equivalent (<code class="kw" translate="no">BINARY</code>, <code
class="kw" translate="no">VARBINARY</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">BLOB</code>), then back to
        characters (<code class="kw" translate="no">CHAR</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">VARCHAR</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">TEXT</code>) with the correct encoding name, e.g., for a <code class="kw" translate="no">TEXT</code> column: <code>ALTER TABLE table CHANGE
        column column BLOB; ALTER TABLE table CHANGE column column TEXT
        CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATION collation;</code>. You can and should change
        all columns of one table together in order to minimize the overhead of
        rebuilding the table.</p>

      <h3 id="filenames"><a href="#filenames">Converting file names</a></h3>
    <p>Several server operating systems (for example, !FreeBSD, Red Hat) store
      file names as simple byte sequences whose interpretation is up to higher
      level processes. Server processes may interpret the byte sequences according
      to the character encoding of the locale they run in, or just pass them on to
      client processes. The actual encoding must therefore be determined by
      evaluating how the name was created, which might be through a web page in the
      default encoding for the particular site or user. If that's not conclusive,
      character encoding detection may also be used.</p>
    <p>If the encoding of a file name can be determined with certainty, it can be
      converted to UTF-8, and a Byte Order Mark can be used to mark it as
      converted. If the encoding is uncertain, it may be necessary to create a
      database parallel to the file system to record the detected encoding and
      possibly the UTF-8 version, so that the original file name can be kept around
      for later correction of the encoding.</p>

    include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Preservation of user-entered text all the way from text entry on the
      keyboard via the application and the database back to redisplay.</li>
    <li>Correct specification of character encodings everywhere.</li>
    <li>Detection of legacy encodings as well as correction of misdetected
      encodings.</li>
    <li>Conversion to other formats, e.g., from form input to RSS feed.</li>
    <li>Searching for text, in particular searches that don't just compare byte
      sequences, e.g., case-insensitive search or search for "similar" text,
      including input in different normalization forms.</li>
    <li>Sorting of strings, including strings in different normalization
      forms.</li>
  </ul>
