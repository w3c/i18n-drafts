  <h2 id="Problem"><a href="#Problem">Problem description</a></h2>
    <p>Web technology is based on the character repertoire of <a class="print" href="https://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html">Unicode</a>/ISO 10646 (see <a class="print" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#sec-RefProcModel">Character Model</a>). Unicode contains a huge number of characters covering a wide range of
      scripts and languages. However, in some cases, there may be something missing:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The character does not exist. Proposed solutions include <a class="print" href="#Encoding">encoding the character</a>, <a href="#Markup">markup for
        individual characters</a>, and <a href="#Private">Private Use Codepoints</a>.</li>
      <li>The character exists, but you want to <a href="#GlyphVariant">select a particular glyph variant</a>.</li>
      <li>A character exists, but the glyph to display it isn't available. This can be solved by technologies such as <a class="print" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/">Web fonts</a>.</li>
      <li>The character exists in Unicode/ISO 10646, but not in the character encoding used for the document. In this case, use Numeric Character
        References (NCRs, example: <code>&amp;#x5678;</code>).</li>
      <li>The character exists in Unicode/ISO 10646, but you want to use a name for it rather than code it directly. You can use named entities
        defined in a DTD (e.g. <code>&amp;eacute;</code> in (X)HTML). Other solutions have been proposed, such as <a class="print" href="http://xmlchar.sourceforge.net/"><code class="kw" translate="no">xmlchar</code></a>,
        which uses an element per character and an XSLT to convert them.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Point 1 and 2 are often subsumed under the term '<a href="#Gaiji">gaiji</a> problem'.</p>

  <h2 id="GlyphVariant"><a href="#GlyphVariant">Selecting Glyph Variants</a></h2>
  <p>Often it is important that a particular <a class="print" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#sec-VisualRenderingUnits">glyph</a> is displayed for a
    certain character. Styling with CSS or XSL can take care of size, font style, and some other properties. But sometimes, there is a need for more
    specific glyph variants. There are various proposals to do this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unicode/ISO 10646 provide <a class="print" href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr28/tr28-3.html#13_7_variation_selectors">variation selectors</a> to
      select a specific variant (range of) glyph(s). Check the <a class="print" href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/StandardizedVariants.txt">list of
      standardized variants</a> to see if the variant you need is available. Otherwise, propose your variant for addition. Please note that all variation
      selectors are reserved for standard use.</li>
    <li>The <a class="print" href="/TR/EGIX/">EGIX Submission</a> proposes to use an attribute, identified by a namespace, to identify glyphs in various XML
      formats.</li>
    <li>JIS X 4052:2000 (日本語文書の組版指定交換形式, Exchange format for Japanese documents with composition markup; in Japanese): The <code class="kw" translate="no">ch</code><code></code> element references an image file containing a glyph image. Attributes are used for exact positioning. The content of the
      element is the character itself, which can serve as a fallback.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="Markup"><a href="#Markup">Markup for Individual Characters and Symbols</a></h2>
  <p>The idea is to define a special element with attributes providing or pointing to the necessary information to process or render the
    character. This leads to an extremely localized, and therefore extremely flexible and stable solution. The actual markup may look very similar to the
    one used for <a href="#GlyphVariant">selecting glyph variants</a>, the main distinction being that there is no character content that serves as a
    fallback (in some cases, the element content may be a primitive fallback such as <code class="kw" translate="no">html:img</code>, or a private use codepoint is used).</p>
  <p>Examples that define markup for individual characters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a class="print" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/">SVG 1.1</a> (a W3C Recommendation): The <a class="print" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/text.html#AltGlyphElement"><code class="kw" translate="no">altglyph</code><code></code></a> element provides detailled control over the glyphs used
      to render particular character data.</li>
    <li><a class="print" href="/TR/MathML2/">MathML 2.0</a> (a W3C Recommendation): The <a class="print" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter3.html#presm.mglyph"><code class="kw" translate="no">mglyph</code><code></code></a> element has an <code class="kw" translate="no">alt</code> attribute for
      fallback text, a <code class="kw" translate="no">fontfamily</code> attribute to indicate a font, and an <code class="kw" translate="no">index</code> attribute to indicate the position of a glyph in a font.</li>
    <li>In Japan, the INSTAC XML WG2 has defined some markup to reference characters (JIS TR X 0047:2001, Picture Reference Exchange by
      XML).</li>
    <li><a class="print" href="http://www.wapforum.org/">WAPForum</a>: The <a class="print" href="http://www1.wapforum.org/tech/terms.asp?doc=WAP-213-WAPInterPic-20010406-a.pdf">pictogram spec</a> is designed to transmit small symbolic
      images (called emoji (絵文字) in Japanese) to Web phones.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Is there a need for a generic element or attribute that could be used widely? Does defining a common anchestor type for such elements help?
    There is also a need to describe character properties. See e.g. the <a class="print" href="http://kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/projects/chise/index.html.en#topicmaps">CHISE project</a>, which uses topic maps.</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="Encoding"><a href="#Encoding">Encoding Characters</a></h2>
  <p>It is possible to <a class="print" href="https://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html">submit a proposal</a> for encoding some characters to the Unicode
    Technical Committee and ISO/IEC SC2 WG2. This requires careful preparation and takes time, but for many cases, it is the right thing to do. On the
    other hand, some things perceived as characters may not be suitable for encoding, or a character may already have been encoded, but you want a
    particular <a href="#GlyphVariant">glyph variant</a>.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2 id="Private"><a href="#Private">Private Use Codepoints</a></h2>
  <p>Unicode/ISO 10646 reserve the Private Use Area in the BMP (U+E000-U+F8FF) and planes 15 and 16 for private use. This means that these
    codepoints are forever left undefined, but can be used between any two parties with a prior agreement.</p>
  <p>The main problem with private use codepoints is that there needs to be an understanding of what these codepoints are used for. But private
    agreements scale very badly on the Web. Various proposals have been made to associate additional information with a document type (DTD/XML Schema),
    with a document, or with some part of a document.</p>
  <p>However, in all cases, editing and otherwise processing documents with such associated information will become very complicated. Also,
    character information is only preserved if all operations that process it preserve the associated information correctly. Because missing characters
    are not a very frequent problem, it is quite unreasonable that e.g. every single Perl script dealing with XML will do the right thing. Using <a href="#Markup">markup for individual missing characters</a> is much more stable.</p>
