    <p>In this article we look at design and development practices that can cause major problems for translation. Designers must be very
      careful about how they split up and reuse text on-screen because the linguistic differences between languages can lead to real headaches for
      localizers and may in some cases make a reasonable translation impossible to achieve.</p>
    <p>After reviewing the concepts and issues relating to text fragmentation and string reuse, we will look at what works and what
      doesn't.</p>

  <h2 id="composite"><a href="#composite">Composite Messages</a></h2>
  <p><span class="newterm">Composite messages</span> dynamically compose a single message from more than one text string. The usual reason for
    creating composite messages is that one or more parts of the composite message will change according to the context.</p>
  <p>Composite messages are typically arranged in one of two ways: the first is a <span class="newterm">sentence-like</span> arrangement; the
    second, a <span class="newterm">topic-comment</span> arrangement.</p>
  <p>The parts of a composite message that vary are referred to here as <span class="newterm">substrings</span>. </p>
    
  <section>
    <h3 id="sentential"><a href="#sentential">Sentence-like arrangements</a></h3>
    <p>The example below is of a sentence-like composite message. This arrangement expresses an idea using a flowing, sentence-like syntax.
      It is usually the most problematic approach.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <!--table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="375" id="compositeString">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="50"></td>

            <td width="25" style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 8em;" rowspan="3">}</td>
           <td width="25" rowspan="3"><img src="images/right-bracket.png" alt="right bracket" /></td>
            <td width="150"></td>

            <td width="150"><pre>has been disabled.</pre></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td width="50"></td>
            <td width="125" style="vertical-align: top;" valign="top"><pre>stapler options</pre></td>
            <td width="150"></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table-->
       <table id="compositeString">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td style="font-size: 3em; line-height: .8em; padding: 0;" rowspan="3">{</td>
            <td><samp>printer</samp></td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><samp>The</samp></td>
            <td><samp>stacker</samp></td>
            <td><samp>has been disabled.</samp></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td><samp>stapler options</samp></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
   </div>
    <p>In this example, the designer has created a single string to serve for the common parts of three sentences, ie. <code>The ... has been
      disabled.</code>. Three alternating substrings have also been created, and the appropriate one is substituted at runtime to create the appropriate
      message for the context.</p>
    <p>This is generally a popular idea with designers because reducing the identical parts of a number of messages to a single string
      appears to offer a way to reduce the work of the text author, improve message consistency, and optimize memory.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, even if this works in one language, it can be either difficult or impossible to deal with such composite messages in
      other languages because of differing rules for sentence structure, agreement and so on.</p>
    <p>The problem of agreement is already illustrated in the English example. If the alternative string <code>stapler options</code> is used
      at runtime, the word <code>has</code> will be incorrect - it should say <code>have</code>.</p>
    <p>The key issue is that, since there is now only a single string containing the word <code>has</code>, it cannot read <code>have</code> when needed.</p>
    <p>This often gets even more complicated when we translate into other languages. For example, in French the word for <code>the</code> would be translated <code lang="fr">le</code>, <code lang="fr">la</code>, <code lang="fr">les</code>, or <code lang="fr">l'</code>, depending on what immediately follows. Similarly, the word <code>disabled</code> would need to be <code lang="fr">désactivé</code>, <code lang="fr">désactivés</code>, <code lang="fr">désactivée</code>, <code lang="fr">désactivées</code>, depending on the gender and number of the subject. Even if <code>stapler options</code> had not
      been an option, and the composite messages had all looked fine in English, the French translator would have been faced with an impossible job.</p>

    <h3 id="subjpred"><a href="#subjpred">Topic-comment arrangements</a></h3>
    <p>Topic-comment arrangements state a topic (the subject) and then state something about it (the comment), usually in a terse way. For
      example: <code>Printer: enabled</code>. Note that the colon is very commonly used to separate topic and comment in this arrangement.</p>
    <p>Here is an example that shows some variations on the theme of the topic-comment arrangement.</p>
    <p><img src="index-data/image1.gif" alt="Screen showing the text described." width="500" height="304" /></p>
    <p> The topics are unchanging strings such as <code>2-sided printing</code>, [Tray] <code>1</code>, and <code>Binder</code>. Each topic
      is followed by one of a set of alternative (and pre-defined) comment strings. For example, the topic <code>2-sided printing</code> is followed by the
      comment <code>On</code>. Note how the topic and the comment are in <em>separate</em> display areas here, though that is not always the case. </p>
    <p>Most of the messages above are split across two text display areas. The message referring to the binder, however, is split across <em>three</em> display areas - that is, the topic has two comments: the binder is both <code>Enabled</code> and <code>On</code>. This is a perfectly
      valid approach and poses no issues for translation.</p>
    <p>Here are some other examples of topic-comment composite messages.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>The comments here are also translatable text substrings, although in this case all the comments are visible at the same time — that
        is, this is an example of a substring-list. In many languages words like <code>lighter</code> and <code>darker</code> will have to agree in gender
        with the topic (<code>Image quality</code>).</p>
      <form action="none" method="post">
        <fieldset>
          <legend>Image quality</legend>
          <p>Lighter/darker<br />
            <input type="radio" id="lighter" />
            <label for="lighter">Lighter</label>
            <br />
            <input type="radio" checked="checked" id="normal" />
            <label for="normal">Normal</label>
            <br />
            <input type="radio"
								id="darker" />
            <label for="darker">Darker</label>
          </p>
        </fieldset>
      </form>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Here we are dealing with a pull-down menu, but the concepts remain the same. The words <code>Left</code>, <code>Centre</code> and <code>Right</code> are translatable text substrings and in many languages must agree with the topic <code>Alignment</code> when translated.</p>
      <p><img src="index-data/pulldown.gif" alt="Picture of a pull down list, showing the sequence of commands, Format > Alignment > Left/Centre/Right" width="203" height="136" /></p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <p>The messages in this set are implemented as variables embedded in parent strings. They nonetheless retain the topic-comment
        arrangement. Note that on the last line the topic again has two comments - the test is both completed and passed.</p>

    <h3 id="substrings"><a href="#substrings">Substring types</a></h3>
    <p>There are several types of substring, each of which introduces slightly different requirements for translatability. In this article we
      will refer to the following types of substring:</p>
    <p><span class="leadinHeader">Predefined, translatable text.</span> Pre-defined words or phrases in the message set that will need to be
      translated, such as the words <code>printer</code>, <code>stacker</code> or <code>binder</code> in the example above.</p>
    <p><span class="leadinHeader">Non-translatable, runtime defined text.</span> A non-translatable and non-numeric string that is generated
      by the user at runtime or a non-translatable name, as in <code>Error occurred while processing job %s</code>, where %s is the name of the job as
      supplied by the user.</p>
    <p><span class="leadinHeader">Numeric.</span> A numeric string that is generated at runtime by the product or is one of a set of fixed
      values such as <code>Pages printed: %d</code>, where %d is the number of pages the machine has counted so far.</p>
    <p><span class="leadinHeader">Graphic.</span> A graphic selected from a number of alternatives as part of a composite message, for
      example, a symbol of a paper tray embedded in text related to paper trays. This is not strictly a substring, but we can regard it as such since it
      may be used in a similar way.</p>

    <h3 id="syntax"><a href="#syntax">Inflexible syntax</a></h3>
    <p>The following problems are a common feature of sentence-like composite messages. The original text assumes a particular order for the
      words in a sentence, and that order may need to be different in another language.</p>
    <div class="h4">
      <h4>Across separate display areas.</h4>
      <p>One common problem is caused when composite message components are spread across different display
      areas, making it difficult to reorder those components easily.</p></div>
    <p>The following example shows a composite message whose parts are split across different table cells for purposes of layout. (A dotted
      line shows the cell boundaries.)</p>
    <div class="example">
      <table style="width:auto;">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="white-space:nowrap; border: 1px dotted gray; line-height:1; vertical-align:middle;">Return web pages updated</td>
            <td style="text-align: left; border: 1px dotted gray; line-height:1;"><select style="margin:0; padding: 0; font-size: 15px;">
                <option value="all">anytime</option>
                <option value="m3">past 3 months</option>
                <option value="m6">past 6 months</option>
                <option value="y">past year</option>
              </select></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>In order to achieve a good translation, the translator may want to move the text in one table cell to another. This may change the
      originally intended layout of the designer who implemented the table. For example, the word order in German can lead to a translation such as the
      following:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <table lang="de">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="border: 1px dotted gray; text-align: left; line-height:1;"><select style="font-size: 15px;">
                <option value="all">Jederzeit</option>
                <option value="m3">Innerhalb von drei Monaten</option>
                <option value="m6">Innerhalb von sechs Monaten</option>
                <option value="y">Innerhalb einen Jahres</option>
              </select></td>
            <td style="white-space:nowrap; text-align: right; border: 1px dotted gray; line-height:1; vertical-align:middle;">veränderte Webseiten abrufen. </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>If a translator is unable to reorder the message in this way, they may be able to use a topic-comment arrangement to resolve this
      issue. Otherwise, the result is likely to be, at best, a very poor translation. For example, the text could be reworded in the target language to
      mean:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="white-space:nowrap; border: 1px dotted gray; white line-height:1; vertical-align:middle;">Time period for returned web pages:</td>
            <td style="text-align: right; border: 1px dotted gray;"><select style="font-size: 15px;">
                <option value="all">anytime</option>
                <option value="m3">past 3 months</option>
                <option value="m6">past 6 months</option>
                <option value="y">past year</option>
              </select></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <div class="h4">
      <h4>Variables that cannot be reordered.</h4>
      <p>It must be possible to reorder variables in sentence-like arrangements and reposition them in any way relative to the text.</p>
    </div>
    <p>For example, when programming in PHP it is possible to code the string "There were &lt;number&gt; spelling mistakes in file
      &lt;filename&gt;." as follows:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p><code>printf( "There were %d spelling mistakes in file %s.", spellerrors, filename)</code></p>
    </div>
    <p>Unfortunately, if you do so, and if the translator produces the German translation as "<span lang="de">Datei
      &lt;filename&gt; enthält &lt;number&gt; Rechtschreibfehler.</span>" this is likely to introduce a bug into the code. That is because PHP does not
      allow you to reorder values of the <code>%d</code> and <code>%s</code> variables.</p>
    <p>Instead you should code the text as:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p><code>printf( "There were %1\$d spelling mistakes in file %2\$s.", spellerrors, filename)</code></p>
    </div>
    <p>This will now allow the translator to reorder the variables without potentially introducing a bug.</p>
    <p>The translated string, reintegrated into the code, would read:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p lang="de"><code>printf( "Datei %2\$s enthält %1\$d Rechtschreibfehler.", spellerrors, filename)</code></p>
    </div>
    <p>This issue is by no means specific to PHP. Many programming languages allow you to attach a unique identifier to a variable so that
      there is no ambiguity when variables are moved around. You should try to always take advantage of this feature.</p>
    <div class="h4">
      <h4 style="display: inline;">Composite messages that are incomplete strings.</h4>
      <p>A much more serious situation can arise given an example such as the following:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <pre>print( "Retrieving last " );
print( desiredEntries );
print( " of " );
print( totalEntries );
print( " total log entries." );</pre>
    </div>
    <p>The Japanese translation would put <code>total log entries</code> at the beginning of the sentence and <code>last retrieving</code> at
      the end. Much more importantly, it would be necessary to reverse the order of <code>print(desiredEntries)</code> and <code>print(totalEntries)</code>. (In the example below I have added translations, to help you see how the text would need to be reordered.)</p>
    <div class="example">
      <pre lang="ja">print( "エラーログ" );        // translation: 'error log'
print( totalEntries );
print( "件から最新" );        // translation: 'from last'
print( desiredEntries );
print( "件を取り出します。" ); // translation: 'retrieving'</pre>
    </div>
    <p>The problem is that translators are normally prevented, with good reason, from changing anything but the strings in code. Otherwise an
      inadvertent edit can introduce a serious bug. Thus, a translator is likely to be presented with the following text for translation:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <pre>1: "Retrieving last "
2: " of "
3: " total log entries."</pre>
    </div>
    <p>The main issue here is that the translator would <em>have to</em> edit the code to produce the most appropriate translation in
      Japanese. This is highly undesirable. In addition, there is also a risk that the translator struggles to identify the beginning and end of such
      messages, especially if the strings are not supplied to the translator together and in order.</p>
    <p>Note that similar problems also arise in code that looks like the following example. Even though this is in a single print statement,
      it doesn't improve matters.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p><code>print( "Retrieving last " + requiredEntries + " of " + totalEntries + " total log entries." );</code></p>
    </div>
    <p>A better approach would be to use a print function that allows you to specify the variables as a part of the string to print. For
      example:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p><code>print( "Retrieving last $requiredEntries of $totalEntries total log entries." );</code></p>
    </div>

  <section>
    <h3 id="ling-concat"><a href="#ling-concat">Agreement and word/concept mappings</a></h3>
    <div class="h4">
      <h4>Gender agreement.</h4>
      <p>Predefined, translatable text substrings in a sentence-like arrangement can create insurmountable difficulties for the translator
        because of the linguistic properties of many languages.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The following example shows a sentence-like parent string into which the appropriate predefined substring will be inserted at
      run-time.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>The %s has been disabled.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The %s will be replaced at run-time with one of:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>printer</p>
      <p>stacker</p>
      <p>stapler options</p>
    </div>
    <p>The problem here is already visible even in English, since the word <code>has</code> should be <code>have</code> alongside the
      substring <code>stapler options</code>. In French, the substrings above are, respectively, feminine singular, masculine singular and feminine plural,
      and would require three very different translations of the parent string:</p>
    <div class="example" lang="fr">
      <p>L'imprimante a été désactivée.</p>
      <p>Le module de reception a été désactivé.</p>
      <p>Les options d'agrafage ont été désactivées.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The word <code>the</code> may also be <code lang="fr">la</code> in French if the next word is feminine and begins with a
      consonant, and the word <code>disabled</code> would need to be translated <code lang="fr">désactivés</code> for a masculine plural
      noun. Such agreement is extremely common in languages other than English or Japanese and can often be more complicated than in French.</p>
    <p>The key issue here is that, since we only have one string to translate, it is impossible to apply the various appropriate translations
      in French to the parent string.</p>
    <p>Such an implementation probably arose from the designer's or developer's attempts to improve the situation, but unfortunately a lack
      of knowledge about what would happen in translation has created a major problem for the foreign versions of the product.</p>
    <p>A better approach here would be either to use separate strings, or to use a topic-comment arrangement, such as <code>Disabled
      function: printer</code>, etc. Note that in the latter case the word <code>disabled</code> refers to <code>function</code>, and is therefore
      unchanging.</p>
    <div class="h4">
      <h4>Word and concept mappings.</h4>
      <p>Word and concept mappings can also cause problems. Take, for example, the sequence:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <p><code>Turn on the %s.</code></p>
    </div>
    <p>The %s will be replaced at run-time with one of:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>printer</p>
      <p>stacker</p>
      <p>stapler options</p>
    </div>
    <p>In some languages, the appropriate translation for <code>Turn on</code> may vary according to what is being turned on. For example,
      Spanish may translate this idea with distinct terms such as <span class="qterm" lang="es">conectar</span>, <span class="qterm" lang="es">encender</span> or <span class="qterm" lang="es">activar</span>. There would also be four
      possible translations for the word <code>the</code>. Since there is only one instance of the initial string, it is again impossible to provide a
      quality translation.</p>
    <p>You should always try to ensure that the invariant part is expressed as a topic.</p>
    <div class="h4">
      <h4>Gender agreement and runtime-defined substrings.</h4>
      <p>Here we refer specifically to text supplied at runtime — such as a file name, job name, person's name and so on — or to
        non-translatable names. These are not predefined translatable substrings.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Normally, even in sentence-like arrangements, these types of substring do not cause internationalization problems. For example, the
      translated sentences below do not need to agree with the text substring since the subject of the sentence (ie. in this case <code>file</code> or <code>section</code>) is already defined or clearly inferred to be something different from the substring itself.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>The file &lt;file_name&gt; has been scanned.</p>
      <p>The section &lt;section_title&gt; gives further information.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In linguistic terms, this works because the text of the variable is provided <em>in apposition</em> to the subject.</p>
    <p>Putting in words like section and file is recommended, rather than inferring them. This helps the translator understand the meaning of
      the message.</p>
    <p>There is, however, an exception to this rule. If the text variable refers to a <em>person</em> rather than an object, many languages
      will still require changes to other parts of the sentence according to the gender of the person. For example:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>The patient &lt;person's_name&gt; is ready.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Spanish translations for this could be:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p lang="es">El enfermo Richard está listo.</p>
    </div>
    <p>or</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p lang="es">La enferma Julia está lista.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In other words, embedded runtime-defined substrings only work in sentence-like arrangements if they don't represent a proper noun. It
      is better to use topic-comment arrangements for these types of message.</p>
    <div class="h4">
      <h4>Number agreement.</h4>
      <p>Numeric substrings do not work well in sentence-like arrangements.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In many languages the word that is qualified by a number changes according to how many we are talking about. Take for example the
      message <code>%d pages were printed</code>.</p>
    <p>In English, <code>pages were</code> should become <code>page was</code> if only one page was printed. Sometimes authors try to get
      around this by saying <code>%d page(s) printed</code>.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, things are not so simple in other languages. For example, Arabic has different verb and noun endings for one page, two
      pages and more than two pages, that is, they have two different types of plural.</p>
    <p>Russian is even more complicated. The accompanying table shows the endings for the word <span class="qterm">page</span> in Russian
      when associated with different numbers.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Number of pages</th>
        <th>Russian word for 'page'</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td lang="ru">страниц<strong class="russian-highlight">а</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2-4</td>
        <td lang="ru">страниц<strong class="russian-highlight">ы</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5-10</td>
        <td lang="ru">страниц</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>11-20 (irregular)</td>
        <td lang="ru">страниц</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>21</td>
        <td lang="ru">страниц<strong class="russian-highlight">а</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>22-24</td>
        <td lang="ru">страниц<strong class="russian-highlight">ы</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>25-30</td>
        <td lang="ru">страниц</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&gt; 30</td>
        <td>Repeat pattern of endings for 1 to 10.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>As a result, it is extremely difficult to deal with such a message expressed in a sentence-like arrangement. It is therefore better to
      always express messages containing numbers like this as a topic-comment arrangement. In a topic-comment arrangement, the word <span
					class="qterm">pages</span> remains invariant. The Russian equivalent, meaning <code>Pages printed: %d</code>, is shown below.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p lang="ru">Отпечатано страниц: %d</p>
    </div>
  </section>
    
  <section>
    <h3 id="indistinguishable"><a href="#indistinguishable">Indistinguishable substrings</a></h3>
    <p>If a translator is to switch the order of substrings in a message, it must be clear what the intended new order is.</p>
    <p>Take the following example:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>%s near '%s' at line %d</p>
    </div>
    <p>A Japanese translation of this would be </p>
    <div class="example">
      <p lang="ja">%d 行の％s近くに％s</p>
    </div>
    <p>What is not clear from looking at this example is that the translator intended to reverse the two variables called %s. This, of
      course, is not clear to the software, either.</p>
    <p>It therefore makes sense to use a unique identifier for each variable in a string. We have already seen that, in PHP, for example, you
      could obtain this by coding the English as:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>%1\$s near '%2\$s' at line %3\$d</p>
    </div>
    <p>In Japanese this would give:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p lang="ja">%3\$d 行の％2\$s近くに％1\$s</p>
    </div>
  </section>
    
  <section>
    <h3 id="context"><a href="#context">The need for context</a></h3>
    <p>The translator must be provided with a means to associate a comment with its topic in order to achieve a translation.</p>
    <p>For many languages it is usually not possible to translate the comment part of a topic-comment message unless you know what the topic
      is. The word <code>enabled</code> in French is translated in one of four different ways, according to whether the topic is masculine, feminine,
      singular or plural:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Topic</th>
        <th>Part of speech</th>
        <th>Translation of 'enabled'</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>stacker</td>
        <td>masculine, singular</td>
        <td lang="fr">activé</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>printer</td>
        <td>feminine, singular</td>
        <td lang="fr">activée</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>bar codes</td>
        <td>masculine, plural</td>
        <td lang="fr">activés</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>stapler options</td>
        <td>feminine, plural</td>
        <td lang="fr">activées</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>In other languages there are many other possibilities, since there are more than two genders and there may be case endings.</p>
    <p>If the translator were presented with the word <code>enabled</code> on its own for translation, he or she would have no idea how it
      should be translated. For example, presenting text to the translator in the following order would prove very difficult to handle.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <pre>enabled
disabled
enabled
enabled
disabled
stacker
printer
enabled
bar codes
stacker
disabled
etc.
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>The only way to address this is to attempt a translation, look at the result in completed interface, and then retranslate as
      necessary. This is a time consuming process. It would be much better to ensure that the translator can see straight away how these things
      correspond.</p>
    <p>There are a number of ways of achieving this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The text could be ordered so that it is intuitive what goes where.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <pre>stacker
enabled
disabled
stacker
enabled
disabled
printer
enabled
disabled
etc.
</pre>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The correspondences could be indicated by message ids.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Designers could use some kind of annotation to provide this information.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Differences may also be semantic in nature. For example, if the word <code>on</code> was used here rather than <code>enabled</code>,
      the appropriate translation in Spanish may be <code lang="es">encendida</code> for the printer but <code lang="es"
					xml:lang="es">activadas</code> for the stapler options. <code lang="es">conectado</code> is another translation of the word <code>on</code>. Each of these three words also has four agreement forms. This gives 12 possible translations.</p>

  <h2 id="recommendations"><a href="#recommendations">Recommendations</a></h2>
  <p> <mark>Use a topic-comment approach whenever possible.</mark> Topic-comment composite messages work well whether the parts
    are in a single or multiple displayers, and with any type of substring.</p>
  <p> <mark>Avoid sentence-like arrangements when they contain substrings that are predefined translatable text or numeric
    text.</mark> </p>
  <p> <mark>Use sentence-like arrangements with care if you have non-numeric and non-translatable text substrings</mark> (ie.
    text created at runtime). Do not use if the substring represents a proper noun. In addition, implement sentence-like messages such that the text and
    substrings can be easily repositioned in any order during translation. When writing program code this usually means using format strings for output
    in such a way that each variable is uniquely identified.</p>
  <p> <mark>Where the parts of a composite message appear in separate locations, provide the translator with contextual
    information to show how the various parts of a composite message relate to each other</mark> - especially which substrings relate to which other
    composite message parts. Preferably composite message parts should be grouped together for delivery to the translator.</p>
  <p> <mark>Provide information to the translator, where needed, to clarify what a substring represents</mark> (eg. something
    like "%s near '%s' at line %d" can pose a challenge for a translator).</p>
  <p> <mark>When requested by the localization group, provide information about the size of each substring</mark> to help test
    whether the translation fits in a fixed-size space.</p>
