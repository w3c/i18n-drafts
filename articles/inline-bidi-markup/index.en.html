  <p>It is common for content in Arabic, Hebrew, and other languages that use right-to-left scripts to include numerals or include text from  other scripts. Both of these typically flow  left-to-right within the overall right-to-left  context. </p>
  <p>This article tells you how to write HTML where text with different writing directions is mixed <em>within a paragraph or other HTML block</em> (ie. <dfn id="term_inline">inline or phrasal</dfn> content). (A companion article <a class="print" href="/International/questions/qa-html-dir"><cite>Structural markup and right-to-left text in HTML</cite></a> tells you how to use HTML markup for  elements such as <code translate="no" class="kw">html</code>, and structural markup such as <code translate="no" class="kw">p</code> or <code translate="no" class="kw">div</code> and forms.)</p>

  <p>If  you want to bullet-proof your code for browsers that don't support the CSS shim where tightly-wrapped text is followed inline by a number or a logically separate opposite-direction phrase, add<code translate="no" class="kw"> &amp;rlm;</code> or <code translate="no" class="kw">&amp;lrm; </code>immediately after  the phrase.</p>

    <p class="info">Our focus in this article is inline content, but for information about how <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> should be used on the <code translate="no" class="kw">html</code> tag and for structural markup see <a class="print" href="/International/questions/qa-html-dir"><cite>Structural markup and right-to-left text in HTML</cite></a>.</p>
  </aside>
  <p>In the sections below, we will examine specific examples of what can go wrong, why it goes wrong, and what fixes it. Nevertheless, it is important to realize that, basically, the problems all occur when content in one direction  includes an <em>inline</em> phrase in the opposite direction. We will call these <span class="newterm" id="oppositedirection">opposite-direction phrases</span>. An opposite-direction phrase may be a single directional run (such as a word), or may be a set of directional runs with an embedded change in base direction. </p>
  <p>In the following example, the English sentence contains an opposite-direction phrase between the quotation marks. That phrase, itself, also contains an opposite-direction phrase: the word C++.</p>
  <figure>
    <p><img src="index-data/intro-to-C-right.png" alt="Displayed result of previous code" /></p>
  </figure>
  <p>Common examples of such phrases include quotations, titles of books, articles or plays, formatted numbers (e.g. phone numbers and MAC addresses), street and email addresses, and various names, such as brand names, acronyms, part numbers, site names,  place names, file names (and paths), etc. </p>
  <p>The problem is worse in applications that drop text into a page, say from a database. The application often does not know a-priori whether such text is (or perhaps contains) an opposite-direction phrase, and has to estimate its direction at  run-time by checking the Unicode ranges of its characters. HTML5 introduces a feature for doing so in the browser.</p>
  <p>Whenever an opposite-direction phrase occurs, things can go wrong. That is, something will go wrong if the text includes, without any special &quot;wrapping&quot;, an inline opposite-direction phrase that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>begins or ends with neutral characters,</li>
    <li>begins with a number,</li>
    <li>is followed by a number,</li>
    <li>is followed by another, but logically separate, opposite-direction phrase,</li>
    <li>contains one or more nested phrases whose base direction is opposite to that of the phrase.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Although this list seems daunting, there is no need to determine which, if any, of these cases applies to a particular phrase. There is a simple, default way of &quot;wrapping&quot; opposite-direction phrases that will prevent problems in all of the cases above, and do no harm when none of them apply. We will describe how do such wrapping for HTML5-aware browsers and for others.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>NOTE!</strong> This section includes references to markup  introduced by HTML5 that should simplify various aspects of handling inline bidi text. The  new features are not yet fully implemented in all browsers. We point out what is new. Use the new features where you can, and encourage browsers developers to continue to implement them.</p>
  </div>
  <section>
    <h3 id="dirattribute"><a href="#dirattribute">The <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute</a></h3>
    <p>The <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute sets the base direction for the content of an element. </p>
    <p>To set the default direction of the whole HTML document to right-to-left, add <code>dir=&quot;rtl&quot;</code> to the <code translate="no" class="kw">html</code> tag. This will result in all elements in the document  inheriting a base direction of RTL.</p>
    <p> You can change the base direction for  content within a page by surrounding that content with an element and adding a <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute to indicate the desired direction. </p>
    <p>In principle, the right thing to do for every opposite-direction phrase is to set its base direction by using the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute on an element tightly wrapping the phrase.</p>
    <p>HTML5  changes the semantics of the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute. In browsers that implement this change, the content of the element on which the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute sits will be isolated, in terms of the bidi algorithm, from the content surrounding it. Wrapping the opposite-direction phrases in an element with a <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute, helps address some of the problems listed in the previous section; adding  isolation helps resolve some more.</p>
    <p><a class="print" href="/International/tests/repo/results/the-dir-attribute-isolation">See  which browsers support this</a>.</p>
    <p>Check out the worked examples below to see how this works.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="lrmrlm"><a href="#lrmrlm">LRM/RLM</a></h3>
    <p>The visual order in which text is displayed can sometimes be modified  using two invisible Unicode control characters: LRM (U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK) which can be added to the source text using the character itself or the escapes <code>&amp;#x200E;</code> or <code>&amp;lrm;</code>, and RLM (U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK), for which the escapes are <code>&amp;#x200F;</code> or <code>&amp;rlm;)</code>. Each has the strong type indicated by its name, like an  A or an  א, but is invisible.</p>
    <p>One use of LRM and RLM is to <em>extend</em> a directional run through neutral or weak characters at the start or end of an opposite-direction phrase, by putting a mark of the same direction as the phrase on the other side of those neutral or weak characters. You can see an example of how it works in the advanced usage notes for <a href="#usecase1">use case 1</a> below.</p>
    <p>Another use is to separate  an opposite-direction phrase from some  neighboring but independent text that would otherwise be incorrectly treated as the same directional run (see <a href="#usecase3">use case 3</a> for a good example). To do this you can put between them a directional mark with the same directionality as the overall context.</p>
    <p>In HTML5,  where the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute is isolating, both cases are better addressed by  adding the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute to an element wrapping the opposite-direction   phrase, so there is really no need to use LRM/RLM. See below for details.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="dirauto"><a href="#dirauto">dir=&quot;auto&quot;</a></h3>
    <p>HTML5  addresses another need: text dropped into a page, say from a database, when you don't know its base direction. Before HTML5, you could only set the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute to <code translate="no" class="kw">ltr</code> or <code translate="no" class="kw">rtl</code>, and had to somehow determine yourself which of them was appropriate. </p>
    <p>HTML5 provides a new value for the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute: <code translate="no" class="kw">auto</code>. The <code translate="no" class="kw">auto</code> value tells the browser to look at the first strongly typed character in the element. If it's a right-to-left typed character such as a Hebrew or Arabic letter, the element will get a direction of <code translate="no" class="kw">rtl</code>. If it's, say, a Latin character, the direction will be <code translate="no" class="kw">ltr</code>.</p>
    <p>There are corner cases where this may not give the desired outcome, but it should usually produce the desired result.</p>
    <p>Note that the browser ignores any neutral or weak characters at the beginning of the text when looking for the first strong character. It also ignores anything inside a <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code> element or an element with a <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> tag of its own, including <code translate="no" class="kw">auto</code>.</p>
    <p>Like any other use of the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute in  HTML5, <code>dir=&quot;auto&quot;</code> also directionally isolates its content from its surroundings.<!-- The effect of the isolation is that you do not need to use LRM and RLM to separate a markup-wrapped opposite-direction phrase from a number or a logically separate opposite-direction phrase that happens to follow it. Thus, if you already have an element like <code translate="no" class="kw">a</code> or <code translate="no" class="kw">cite</code> wrapping a phrase of unknown direction, all your bidi wrapping needs are accomplished by adding  <code>dir=&quot;auto&quot;</code> on the existing element.--></p>

  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="bdi"><a href="#bdi">The <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code> element</a></h3>
    <p>HTML5 also introduces a new element, <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code>. It is just like a <code translate="no" class="kw">span</code> except that, whether or not it is used with a <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute, it directionally isolates its content from the surrounding text; &quot;bdi&quot; stands for &quot;bidirectional isolate&quot;. </p>
    <!--p> Since it is actually quite rare not to want to isolate embedded phrases from its surroundings, <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code> (when the browser supports it) can be used instead of a <code translate="no" class="kw">span</code> for bidi-wrapping, and  the use of LRMs and RLMs can be completely avoided.</p-->
    <p><code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code> comes with the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute set to the new <code translate="no" class="kw">auto</code> value by default (see above), however it is also possible to use an explicit <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute on <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code> with values set to <code translate="no" class="kw">ltr</code> or <code translate="no" class="kw">rtl</code>, if you know the direction of the phrase and just want to isolate it.</p>
    <p>The choice of whether to attach <code>dir=&quot;auto&quot;</code> on an existing element or to wrap the phrase in a <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code> depends on whether you already have an inline element tightly wrapping the potentially opposite-direction phrase, and whether you happen to know the phrase's direction (or can guess at it better than the browser's <code>dir=&quot;auto&quot;</code> logic).</p>

To avoid this, you can add an inline element immediately inside the tags of the existing markup, and follow the rules below for marking up that inline element.

  <section>
    <h3 id="unknownuc"><a href="#unknownuc">Tightly wrapping opposite-direction phrases</a></h3>
    <p> The easiest way to address bidi issues in your content is to tightly wrap <em>every</em> <a class="termref" href="#oppositedirection">opposite-direction phrase</a> in markup that sets its base direction. </p>
    <p>By <dfn id="tightwrap">tightly wrapping</dfn>, we mean that the element contains the entire opposite-direction phrase, and nothing but the opposite-direction phrase. </p>
    <p>When none of the problematic use cases  apply, this will not have any visible effect. But when one of them does apply, this provides a simple solution, that doesn't require you to figure out specifically what the problem is.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="html5markup"><a href="#html5markup">HTML5 approach</a></h3>
    <p>The latest version of the  HTML5 specification says that  browsers should change their default style sheet so that the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute isolates the text inside the element from that surrounding it. This means that more of the potential problems pointed out <a href="#where">earlier</a> simply melt away when you tightly wrap all opposite-direction phrases with elements containing <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code>.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin" id="cssshim">The CSS Shim</b>. Unfortunately, not all browsers yet apply isolation when <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> is used. For this reason, during the transitional phase, we recommend that you provide  some CSS yourself to produce the effect of the default style sheet. The following browser versions are known to support the necessary CSS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Firefox 14+</li>
      <li>Chrome 18+</li>
      <li>Safari 6+</li>
      <li>Opera 15+</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Internet Explorer 8-10 doesn't support the CSS, but does use a hack  that produces a similar effect, and is usually good enough.</p>
    <p>Browsers that don't yet support the CSS will simply behave in the same way as before, but most recent versions of major browsers do support the desired behavior already.</p>
    <p>The CSS shim is as follows: </p>
    <figure>
      <pre>[dir='ltr'], [dir='rtl'] { 
	unicode-bidi: -webkit-isolate;
	unicode-bidi: -moz-isolate;
	unicode-bidi: -ms-isolate;
	unicode-bidi: isolate;
	} 
bdo[dir='ltr'], bdo[dir='rtl'] {
	unicode-bidi: bidi-override; 
	unicode-bidi: -webkit-isolate-override; 
	unicode-bidi: -moz-isolate-override; 
	unicode-bidi: -ms-isolate-override; 
	unicode-bidi: isolate-override;
  	}</pre>
    </figure>
    <p><a class="print" href="/International/tests/repo/results/the-dir-attribute-isolation#inheritance">See  which browsers support this</a>.</p>
    <p>At the time of writing, all browser versions that support isolation in CSS also support the <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code> element.</p>
    <p>To  make sure that a phrase that contains any opposite-direction characters is displayed correctly, do the following.</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">If you know the phrase's direction, or can work it out for injected text</b>,   wrap all opposite-direction phrases in an element with a <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute.

If not, add a <code translate="no" class="kw">span</code> element.</p>

    <p>If <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> isolation or the CSS shim is not supported by a browser or browser version, it is not possible to isolate phrases from their surrounding content. It is often possible to achieve a similar effect, however, using an RLM or LRM Unicode control code, if you know the direction of the surrounding text.</p>
    <p>To  make sure that a phrase that contains any opposite-direction characters is displayed correctly, do the following:</p>
    <p><b class="leadin">If you know the  direction of the text surrounding a phrase, or can work it out for injected text</b>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>tightly wrap opposite-direction  phrases in an inline element that uses the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute to set the direction of the phrase, as described above.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>if the  tightly-wrapped phrase in the previous step is followed inline (possibly after some intervening neutral characters) by a number or a logically separate opposite-direction phrase, then add   a directional mark (RLM or LRM) immediately after the markup of that phrase. Choose one that matches the direction of the surrounding context. If you do not want to or cannot check whether the phrase is followed by one of those things, you can add a directional mark matching the direction of the  context after every tightly-wrapped phrase.</p>

    <p><b class="leadin">If you don't know the phrase's direction, ie. unknown text that will be injected at run time</b>, there isn't really a good way to automatically apply the right base direction. However, if you know that one injected phrase may be followed inline by a number or a logically separate opposite-direction phrase, you can  add  a directional mark immediately after  the phrase that matches the direction of the surrounding context  in order to separate the phrase from what follows.</p>
    <p>If the phrase is being injected at run-time and its overall direction is unknown, it can be estimated from the direction of its individual characters, e.g. by using the direction of its first strongly typed character. Open-source code for doing so is available, but HTML does not offer any features for easing this task. It is possible (but not necessary) to skip the steps  above only if both the overall direction of the phrase and the direction of the last strongly typed character in the phrase is the same as the context direction.</p>

    <p> In this example a right-to-left book title is <strong>embedded</strong> in a left-to-right context, and the book title itself contains an embedded left-to-right phrase. Here is the code without any additional bidi markup:</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <div class="badcode"><span><img src="../../icons/dontcopy.png" alt=" "> Bad code. Don't copy!</span> <a href='Overview-egs?test=101' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>

      <p><img src="index-data/intro-to-C-right.png" alt="Displayed result of previous code" /></p>

    <p>Unfortunately,  the bidirectional algorithm cannot tell where the boundaries of the nested changes in base direction should be. The result, without help in the markup, is:</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="usecase1html5" class="notoc"><a href="#usecase1html5">Fixing use case 1 in HTML5</a></h3>
    <p> To address this in HTML5, if there is no other markup around the opposite-direction phrases, wrap both  in markup with<code> </code>the appropriate<code translate="no" class="kw"> dir</code> value.  (Note, by the way, how the markup appears <em>inside</em> the quotation marks, which are part of the English text.)</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <div><a href='Overview-egs?test=102' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
      <p><code>&lt;p&gt;the title is &quot;&lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;AN INTRODUCTION TO &lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;c++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; in arabic.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>
    <p> It is important to note that each phrase is <em>nested</em>. Just wrapping the Arabic in one <code translate="no" class="kw">span</code> followed by a <code translate="no" class="kw">span</code> containing the C++ would result in no improvement at all.</p>
    <div class="advancedusage">
      <p><strong>advanced usage notes:</strong> Note that two elements with <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> are needed in this case. This is because there are two opposite-direction phrases. If only one was used, like this:</p>
      <figure class="example">
        <div class="badcode"><span><img src="../../icons/dontcopy.png" alt=" "> Bad code. Don't copy!</span> <a href='Overview-egs?test=103' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
        <p><code>&lt;p&gt;the title is &quot;&lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;AN INTRODUCTION TO c++&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
      </figure>
      <p>the displayed text would be as shown below. This moves the C++ to the left, as needed, but the + signs appear on the wrong side of the C.</p>
      <figure>
        <p><img src="index-data/intro-to-C-attempt1.png" alt="Displayed result of previous code" /></p>
      </figure>
      <p>This fails  because the &quot;C++&quot; is an opposite-direction (LTR) phrase within the title, ending in neutral characters and the phrase is now being displayed with an RTL base direction. The bidi algorithm has no way of knowing that the plus signs are part of an LTR phrase, not of the RTL context, and thus displays them  to the left of the &quot;C&quot; instead of to its right.</p>
      <p>To solve this problem, wrap  the overall RTL phrase in a <code>&lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;</code>, and the LTR phrase nested inside it in its own <code>&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;</code>, as shown.</p>
    </div>
    <p>If there is already suitable markup to surround the  book title, such as a <code translate="no" class="kw">cite</code> element,  add the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute to that.</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <div><a href='Overview-egs?test=105' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
      <p><code>&lt;p&gt;the title is &lt;cite dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;AN INTRODUCTION TO &lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;c++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; in arabic.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>
    <div class="advancedusage">
      <p><strong>advanced usage notes:</strong> If the &quot;C++&quot; in this example was an ordinary Latin-script word, such as &quot;Python&quot; you wouldn't actually need to mark it up to get the right display. The bidi algorithm would take care of it. However marking up text in this way avoids you having to understand why these two cases are different, and having to work out which case applies for your content. </p>
      <p>Similarly, if the title contained no embedded left-to-right text, you wouldn't actually need directional markup at all, but adding it  avoids possible issues related to following inline text, such as where the text is edited to add a following number or another title, like this:</p>
      <figure class="example1">

    <p>The solution outlined for HTML5 aware browsers will work equally well for browsers that don't support HTML5 features.</p>
    <div class="advancedusage">
      <p><strong>advanced usage notes:</strong> As noted earlier, one use of LRM and RLM is to <em>extend</em> a directional run through neutral or weak characters at the start or end of an opposite-direction phrase, by putting a mark of the same direction as the phrase on the other side of those neutral or weak characters. For this example,  instead of wrapping the &quot;C++&quot; in a <code>&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;</code>, we could add <code>&amp;lrm;</code> after the second plus:</p>
      <figure class="example">
        <div><a href='Overview-egs?test=106' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
        <p><code>&lt;p&gt;the title is &lt;cite dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;AN INTRODUCTION TO c++&amp;lrm;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> </p>
      </figure>
      <p>The result is what we need:</p>
      <figure>
        <p><img src="index-data/intro-to-C-lrm.png" alt="Displayed result of previous code" /></p>
      </figure>
      <p>Because the LRM is a strongly left-to-right character, the  neutral pluses are now between two strong left-to-right characters (the C and the LRM). They therefore also become left-to-right in direction, making a single directional run of the four characters.</p>
      <p>Used this way, however, LRM and RLM are a bit like gotos in programming languages: a quick hack that, unlike the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute, says nothing about the structure of the text. And they simply cannot be used to deal with an opposite-direction phrase that happens to contain a nested phrase in the original direction, like our complete &quot;Introduction to C++&quot; example above. That may seem like an esoteric case, but it is surprisingly common when displaying right-to-left data in a left-to-right page, because the use of left-to-right words (like &quot;C++&quot;) is not uncommon in right-to-left text. </p>
      <p>So, if you don't want to analyze whether LRM and RLM can replace the use of the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute in your case, just use the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute.</p>
    </div>
    <!--div class="advancedusage">
      <p><strong>advanced usage notes:</strong> Nevertheless, it turns out that LRM and RLM do have an essential function dealing with opposite-direction phrases in HTML4: separating an opposite-direction phrase from a number, or from a separate opposite-direction phrase that happens to follow it. It does this by putting between them a mark of the same direction as the context. When used this way, LRM and RLM do not replace the use of the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute, but augment it. See <a href="#usecase2">use case 2</a> and <a href="#usecase3">use case 3</a> below.</p>

    <h3 id="usecase2"><a href="#usecase2">Use case 2: Following numbers</a></h3>
    <p> In the next example, the opposite-direction phrase is <strong>followed by a logically separate number</strong>. This is the code without any bidi markup:</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <div class="badcode"><span><img src="../../icons/dontcopy.png" alt=" "> Bad code. Don't copy!</span> <a href='Overview-egs?test=123' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
      <p><code>&lt;p&gt;we find the phrase 'INTERNATIONALIZATION ACTIVITY' 5 times on the page.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>

      <p><img src="index-data/number-following-wrong.png" alt="Displayed result of previous code" /></p>
    </figure>
    <p style="clear: both;">This happens because the bidi algorithm tells the browser to treat the "5″ as part of the Hebrew text. This is not appropriate here though. We need to find a way to say that the name and the number are separate things, ie. to isolate the inserted name from the number.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3 id="uc2html5" class="notoc"><a href="#uc2html5">Fixing use case 2 in HTML5</a></h3>
  <p> In a browser that supports isolating <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> or the CSS shim, wrap the opposite-direction phrase (the title) in markup and add the appropriate<code translate="no" class="kw"> dir</code> value. There is no need to add anything else, since the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute automatically isolates its content.</p>
  <figure class="example">

  <section>
    <h3 id="uc2html4" class="notoc"><a href="#uc2html4">Fixing use case 2 in browsers that don't support HTML5</a></h3>
    <p> For browsers where <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> doesn't isolate, you would fix this by not only adding the markup around the opposite direction, Hebrew text, but adding also an LRM character after it. That would prevent the number being associated with the right-to-left text.</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <div><a href='Overview-egs?test=109' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
      <p><code>&lt;p&gt;we find the phrase '&lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;INTERNATIONALIZATION ACTIVITY&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lrm;' 5 times on the page.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>
    <p>If the search string was already tightly wrapped by an element, use that element tag to add the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute, and add the LRM character after it.</p>
    <p>Of course, if the overall context is right-to-left, eg. Arabic/Hebrew/etc. text, and the book title was in English, you would need to add an RLM character rather than an LRM character.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="usecase3"><a href="#usecase3">Use case 3: Lists</a></h3>
    <p> Neutrals between same directional runs can  sometimes be misinterpreted by the bidi algorithm. In this use case we have several country names in Arabic listed in a LTR paragraph. This is an example of an opposite-direction phrase <strong>followed by another, but logically separate, opposite-direction phrase</strong>. Here is the source code without any bidi markup:</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <div class="badcode"><span><img src="../../icons/dontcopy.png" alt=" "> Bad code. Don't copy!</span> <a href='Overview-egs?test=110' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
      <p><code>&lt;p&gt;the names of these states in arabic are EGYPT, BAHRAIN and KUWAIT respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>
    <p>We expect to see the following:</p>
    <figure>
      <p><img src="index-data/comma-right.gif" alt="Egypt appears to the left of Bahrain." /></p>
    </figure>
    <p>In the actual result, the first two Arabic words are reversed and the intervening comma is moved to the right side of the space between the words.</p>
    <figure>
      <p><img src="index-data/comma-wrong.gif" alt="Bahrain appears to the left of Egypt." /></p>
    </figure>
    <p>The reason for the failure is that, with a strongly typed right-to-left (RTL) character on either side, the bidirectional algorithm
      sees the neutral comma as part of the Arabic text. It is interpreting the first two Arabic words and the comma as a single directional run in Arabic. In fact it is part of the English text, and should mark the boundary between the two separate right-to-left directional runs in
      Arabic. </p>
    <p>The solution for this use case is similar to that for the previous use case, so we will keep the notes below brief, and assume that you have read the solutions for use cases 1 and 2. We will present just the default markup approach.</p>

  <h2 id="dynamicexamples"><a href="#dynamicexamples">Worked examples for dynamic use cases</a></h2>
  <p>In this section we will look at use cases that involve injecting content into a page at run time.</p>
  <p>It is important to note that we cannot address markup <em>inside</em> the injected content. In all cases below, if the injected phrases contain embedded opposite-direction phrases themselves, these need to be already marked up when the phrase is injected into the page, either in the database, or added by scripting when the injected phrase is fetched. If this is not done, the injected text will look alright for simple cases, but may be problematic for more complex ones. </p>

    <p> In the article <a class="print" href="/International/questions/qa-html-dir"><cite>Structural markup and right-to-left text in HTML</cite></a> there is an example of a page for an online book store that carries books in many languages and needs to display the original book titles regardless of the language of the user interface. Thus, a Hebrew or Arabic book title may appear in an English interface, and vice-versa.</p>
    <p>Let us suppose that you searched for the book <cite lang="he" dir="rtl" style="white-space:nowrap;">הצהרות קידוד תװי CSS</cite> and that that book wasn't found.

    <p> In HTML4 we can't really address this use case using markup, since we need to know in advance the direction of the text. This can only be achieved by knowing the direction of or examining the injected phrase before insertion, and applying the appropriate directional information by scripting.</p>

    <h3 id="uc5"><a href="#uc5">Use case 5: Following numbers</a></h3>
    <p> Here's an example where the names of restaurants are added to a page from a database and followed by a number. You don't know in advance the directionality of the injected text. This is the code produced by the script that injects the phrases, without bidi markup:</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <div class="badcode"><span><img src="../../icons/dontcopy.png" alt=" "> Bad code. Don't copy!</span> <a href='Overview-egs?test=118' target="text"><img class="codelink" style="margin-right: 32%;" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
      <pre>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;aroma&lt;/span&gt; - 3 reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;PURPLE PIZZA&lt;/span&gt; - 5 reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;PURPLE PIZZA roma&lt;/span&gt; - 3 reviews&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    </figure>
    <p>And here's what one would expect to see, and what you'd actually see.</p>
    <figure style="width: 230px; float: left; text-align: center; display: block; margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 10%;">
      <div class="figcaption">What it should look like.</div>
      <p><img src="index-data/restaurant-right.png" title="AZZIP ELPRUP - 5 reviews" alt="AZZIP ELPRUP - 5 reviews"></p>

    <figure style="width: 230px; float: left; text-align: center; display: block; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      <div class="figcaption">What it actually looks like.</div>
      <p><img src="index-data/restaurant-wrong.png" title="5 - AZZIP ELPRUP reviews" alt="5 - AZZIP ELPRUP reviews"></p>
    </figure>
    <p style="clear: both;">The  problem with the second restaurant name arises because the browser thinks that the " – 5″ is part of the Hebrew text. This is what the Unicode Bidi Algorithm tells it to do, and usually it is correct.  Not here though. We need to find a way to say that the name and the number are separate things, ie. to isolate the inserted name from the number.</p>
    <p style="clear: both;">In the third restaurant name the number is back in the right place, but the word 'Roma' is part of the Hebrew name, and should appear to the left of the Hebrew text. In other words, we need to apply a base direction of RTL to the whole of the injected text.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="uc5html5" class="notoc"><a href="#uc5html5">Fixing use case 5 in HTML5</a></h3>
    <p><span class="leadin"></span> Once again, the default rule  when there is no other element around the injected text, is to wrap it in <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code>. The <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code> element automatically isolates the injected phrase from the number, and sets the direction for the phrase based on its first strong character.</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <div><a href='Overview-egs?test=119' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>

    </figure>
    <p></p>
    <p>The <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code> tag automatically assigns a direction based on the first strong character in the injected string.</p>
    <p>You'll notice that the example above puts <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code> around the name Aroma too. Of course, you don't actually need that, but it won't do any harm. On the other hand, it simplifies the necessary script code, and means you can handle any name that comes out of the database, whatever script it is in.</p>
    <p>If there <em>is</em> another element around the injected text, wrap the injected phrase in <code translate="no" class="kw">bdi</code> or use <code>dir=&quot;auto&quot;</code>.</p>

    <p> Again, in HTML4, all we can do is add a LRM character after the injected phrase, to ensure that it is isolated from the number. This would be sufficient to correctly render the second item in the list, because it is a very simple case, with no embedded opposite-direction phrases or neutral characters. The third case, however, will not work so well, since  the base direction has to be set to right-to-left for the word 'Roma' to appear on the left. This can only be properly rendered if the injected phrase has markup added to it before insertion.</p>
    <p>The code would look something like this.</p>

    <h3 id="usecase6"><a href="#usecase6">Use case 6: Punctuation at the end of an opposite-direction phrase</a></h3>
    <p> It is a very common situation for punctuation or some other neutral character to appear at the end of an opposite direction phrase and belong with that phrase.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, such neutrals between different directional runs are typically misinterpreted unless there is additional bidi markup. In the following example, the exclamation mark  should appear at the end of the Arabic text, ie. to
      the left, like this:</p>
    <figure>
      <p><img src="index-data/exclamation-right.gif" alt="An exclamation mark appearing to the left of Arabic text." /></p>
    </figure>
    <p>Unfortunately, if we rely solely on the bidirectional algorithm we see this:</p>
    <figure>
      <div><a href='Overview-egs?test=124' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
      <p><img src="index-data/exclamation-wrong.gif" alt="An exclamation mark appearing to the right of Arabic text." /></p>
    </figure>
    <p>Given our understanding of the bidi algorithm we can easily understand why this happened. Because the exclamation mark was typed in
      between the last RTL letter 'ب' (on the left)‌ and the LTR letter 'i' (of the word 'in') its directionality is determined by the base direction of
      the paragraph, ie. LTR in this case. </p>
    <p>Because the exclamation mark is seen as LTR it joins the directional run that includes the text
      'in Arabic'.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="uc6html4" class="notoc"><a href="#uc6html4">Fixing use case 6 when the direction is known</a></h3>
    <p>The general solution mentioned above works fine: just put the opposite-direction phrase in an element with a <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute. If there isn't already an element present, use a <code translate="no" class="kw">span</code>.</p>
    <figure class="example">

    </figure>
    <div class="advancedusage">
      <p><strong>advanced usage notes:</strong>You could also simply place an RLM after the exclamation mark, but we have already discussed earlier why that is a less ideal fix. Note, also, that when using this solution, without markup, the Arabic text is not marked up for language or styling. Adding markup around the embedded title is probably a better way to solve the problem.</p>

    <p> The picture below shows the  expected result of displaying a telephone number in a right-to-left context, where the area code is surrounded by parentheses, and where the number appears at the beginning of a line or after some right-to-left text.</p>
    <figure>
      <p style="text-align: right;"><img src="index-data/phonenumber-correct.png" alt="Telephone number correctly ordered."></p>

      <p style="text-align: right;"><img src="index-data/phonenumber-incorrect.png" alt="Telephone number incorrectly ordered."></p>
    </figure>
    <p>Because these are numbers, the  order applied by the bidirectional algorithm is slightly different from what we've seen before, but the fix is essentially the same. </p>
    <p> Here is another, somewhat more problematic example of the same thing. The picture below shows a MAC address number as you would expect to see it displayed in a right-to-left context. The sequence 01:02:aa:4a:bb:06 looks exactly the same as it would in a left-to-right context.</p>

      <p style="text-align: right;"><img src="index-data/mac-incorrect.png" alt="MAC address incorrectly ordered."></p>
    </figure>
    <p>This is particularly worrisome, since it's not obvious when the order is incorrect. Even if you did know it was incorrect, it is not at all clear how it should be read.</p>
    <p>Although there are more characters involved, this problem is caused because the bidirectional algorithm assumes that the initial run of numbers (and colons, since they are neutral) are associated with the preceding Hebrew text, rather than part of the Mac address.</p>
    <p>This example indicates that you should always wrap MAC addresses, and similar numbers, with directional information.</p>

  <h2 id="nomarkup"><a href="#nomarkup">What if I can't use markup?</a></h2>
  <p>There are some situations where you may not be able to use the markup described in the previous section. In HTML these include the <code translate="no" class="kw"><code translate="no" class="kw">title</code></code> element and any attribute value.</p>
  <p>In these situations you have to use the invisible Unicode characters	that	produce	the	same results.</p>
  <p>To replicate the effect of the markup described in the example above related to nested base directions, we can use pairs of characters to surround the embedded text. The first character is one of U+202B RIGHT-TO-LEFT EMBEDDING (RLE) or U+202A LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING (LRE). This corresponds to <strong>the pre-HTML5</strong> markup <code>&lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;</code>, respectively, ie. they do not isolate. The second character is U+202C POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING (PDF). This corresponds to the <code>&lt;/span&gt;</code> in the markup. Here's an example.</p>
  <div class="sidenoteGroup">
    <figure class="example">
      <div><a href='Overview-egs?test=133' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
      <p><code>&lt;title&gt;the title says  &quot;&amp;#x202B;<span dir="rtl">INTERNATIONALIZATION ACTIVITY, w3c</span>&amp;#x202C;&quot; in hebrew.&lt;/title&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>
    <aside class="sideinfonote">
      <p class="info">Because the characters are invisible you may prefer to actually type in a numeric character reference, as we have here.</p>
    </aside>
  </div>
  <p>These control characters should only be used for inline phrases, not for block elements such as paragraphs. In general, <a class="print" href="/International/questions/qa-bidi-controls">it is recommended</a> that you use markup where it is available, rather than these character pairs, because it is easier to see and therefore manage the markup, and it is consistent with the approach used for block elements. Where markup is not available, of course, this is the only option.</p>
  <p>The two characters we already met in the above text, <span class="uname">U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</span> (RLM) and <span class="uname">U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK</span> (LRM) can also be used, where appropriate.</p>
  <figure class="example">
    <div><a href='Overview-egs?test=134' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
    <p><code>&lt;title&gt;the title says &quot;INTERNATIONALIZE THE WEB!&amp;#x200F;&quot; in arabic.&lt;/title&gt;</code></p>
  </figure>
  <p>If isolation is necessary, either within the text or when the text is used with surrounding content, in addition to RLE/LRE...PDF, you may also need to add the LRM or RLM marks as described in the <a href="#html4markup">section about legacy browser support</a>.</p>
  <p>Note that in the example just shown the Arabic text is no longer marked up for language or styling. Also, because the character is invisible you may prefer to actually type in a numeric character reference (&amp;#x200F;) as we did here, or, if available, a character entity (such as &amp;rlm; in HTML).</p>
  <p><strong>From Unicode version 6.3 onwards</strong>, the Unicode Standard   contains new control codes (RLI, LRI, FSI, PDI) to enable authors to express isolation at the same time as direction in inline bidirectional text. The Unicode Consortium recommends that isolation <em>be used as the default</em> for all future inline bidirectional text embeddings. To use these new control codes, however, it will be necessary to wait until the browsers support them. The new control codes are:</p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>RLI</td>
        <td>U+2067 RIGHT-TO-LEFT ISOLATE</td>
        <td>Sets direction to rtl </td>

  <h2 id="mirrored"><a href="#mirrored">Mirrored characters</a></h2>
  <p>You may have noticed that, in addition to changing position, one of the parentheses in the previous example actually changed shape, too. This was completely automatic, and happens because these characters are what are known as mirrored characters in Unicode.</p>
  <p><dfn>Mirrored characters</dfn> are usually pairs of characters, such as parentheses, brackets, and the like, whose shape when displayed is dependent upon whether it is part of a LTR or RTL context. You do not have to change the character for the shape to change. </p>
  <p>The ends of an opening parenthesis always face in the direction of the text flow, and closing parentheses face the other way. </p>
  <p>In the picture below, the parenthesis circled in red faces to the right in the top line and to the left in the bottom line. The only difference between the two lines is that we put a span around the Latin text in the bottom line and set the base direction to <code translate="no" class="kw">ltr</code>. What you are seeing is exactly the same character – we have only changed the markup.</p>
  <p>On the top line, the bidi algorithm thinks the closing parenthesis is part of the RTL text, and so it faces right. On the bottom line, the bidi algorithm treats it as a LTR closing parenthesis, so it faces left.</p>

    <div><a href='Overview-egs?test=136' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
    <p style="text-align:right;"><img src="index-data/mirrored-parens.png" alt="Mirrored characters." /></p>
  </figure>
  <p>This means that, whether the stored content is in Arabic/Hebrew or Latin script, you would use the same <span class="uname">LEFT PARENTHESIS</span> character at the beginning of the parenthesized text. In other words, treat mirrored characters as if any word <code translate="no" class="kw">left</code> in the name meant '<span class="qterm">opening</span>', and <span class="kw">right</span> meant '<span class="qterm">closing</span>'. </p>
  <p>Unicode 6.3 introduces to the Bidirectional Algorithm some new rules for handling paired characters, such as brackets and parentheses. These should help to reduce problems in problematic areas. You don't need to take any action to enable these improvements. It's simply a case of waiting for the browser to implement the new behaviour.</p>

  <h2 id="override"><a href="#override">Overriding the algorithm</a></h2>
  <p>There may be occasions where you don't want the bidi algorithm to do its reordering work at all. In these cases you need some additional
    markup to surround the text you want left unordered.</p>
  <p>In HTML  this is achieved using the inline <span class="kw">bdo</span> element. (In other XML applications, such as XHTML2, it may be implemented as a value of <code translate="no" class="kw">rlo</code> or <code translate="no" class="kw">lro</code> on the <code translate="no" class="kw">dir</code> attribute, enabling it to be applied to any element.) Again, there are Unicode control
    characters you could use to achieve the same result, but because they create states with invisible boundaries this is generally <a class="print" href="/International/questions/qa-bidi-controls">not recommended</a>.</p>
  <p>Examples that show the characters as ordered in memory use the <code translate="no" class="kw">bdo</code> tag to achieve that effect. For example, the picture below shows Hebrew text as ordered in memory.</p>
  <figure>
    <div><a href='Overview-egs?test=137' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
    <p><img src="index-data/override.png" alt="Shows Hebrew text in the order stored in memory." /></p>
  </figure>
  <p>For the bottom line we would use the following markup in HTML:</p>
  <figure class="example">
    <div><a href='Overview-egs?test=138' target="text"><img class="codelink" src="../../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
    <p><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;bdo dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;<span dir="rtl">INTERNATIONALIZATION ACTIVITY, w3c</span>&lt;/bdo&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
  </figure>
  <p>Note that the CSS shim described earlier in this article contains code that applies isolation to the <code translate="no" class="kw">bdo</code> element.</p>
