Short i18n review checklist is [here](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/reviews/shortchecklist)

1. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) contains any natural language text that will be read by a human (this includes error messages or other UI text, JSON strings, etc, etc),_

    Comments go here.
    
2. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) allows content authors to produce typographically appealing text, either in its own right, or in association with graphics._

    Comments go here.

3. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) allows the user to point into text, creates text fragments, concatenates text, allows the user to select or step through text (using a cursor or other methods), etc._

    Comments go here.

4. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) allows searching or matching of text, including syntax and identifiers_

    Comments go here.

5. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) sorts text_

    Comments go here.

6. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) captures user input_

    Comments go here.

7. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) deals with time in any way that will be read by humans and/or crosses time zone boundaries_

    Comments go here.

8. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) allows any character encoding other than UTF-8._

    Comments go here.

9. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) defines markup._

    Comments go here.

10. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) deals with names, addresses, time & date formats, etc_

    Comments go here.

11. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) describes a format or data that is likely to need localization._

    Comments go here.

12. [ ] _If the spec (or its implementation) makes any reference to or relies on any cultural norms_

    Comments go here.

<section>
  <p>This page points developers of specifications to various aspects of their spec that may need internationalization review. It can also be used by spec reviewers, to get an idea of what to look for in a spec.</p>
<p>The text of this page is still being perfected, and is not exhaustive. Please raise any comments using <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues/">GitHub issues</a>.</p>
