<p>In addition to the usual candidates (Arabic, Hebrew, N'Ko, Syriac, Thaana, etc.) a number of other writing systems that are nowadays written left-to-right were once written in a right-to-left direction. These writing systems include Chinese, Japanese, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Tifinagh, Old Norse runes, and a good number of other now archaic scripts. </p>

<p>Since the Unicode Standard applies strong LTR directionality to the characters in these scripts, it's not possible to simply apply the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm to display them correctly. Furthermore, some of these scripts mirror the shapes of the character glyphs when they run right-to-left.</p>
<p>This article describes a way to produce runs of right-to-left text for these languages using HTML &amp; CSS.</p>

  <h2 id="processing"><a href="#processing">Summary</a></h2>
    <p>Here we summarise the bare bones of the solution. Read the rest of the article for more detail.</p>
<p>Wrap your text in an (inline) <code class="kw" translate="no">bdo</code> element and set the <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> attribute to <code class="kw" translate="no">rtl</code>. If it is alone on a line set the alignment for that line to bring it to the right side of the window.</p>
<figure class="example">
<p><code>p[lang=zh-hant] { text-align: right; }</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;p lang=&quot;zh-hant&quot;&gt;&lt;bdo dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;<span lang="zh-hant">Êú¨ÂúüÂåñ ÂèçÊàêÂúãÈöõÂåñÂç±Ê©ü</span>&lt;/bdo&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
<div class="demolink"><a href="qa-ltr-scripts-in-rtl-data/eg_simple" target="text">Test in your browser.</a></div>
</figure>
<p>If your text includes any characters that need to run left-to-right, wrap those in a <code class="kw" translate="no">bdo</code> element with <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> set to <code class="kw" translate="no">ltr</code>. (This is very much how one writes markup for Arabic, Hebrew, etc. except that they don't use the <code class="kw" translate="no">bdo</code> tag.)</p>
<figure class="example">
<p><code>p[lang=zh-hant] { text-align: right; }</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;p lang=&quot;zh-hant&quot;&gt;&lt;bdo dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;&lt;bdo dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;8.6%&lt;/bdo&gt;<span lang="zh-hant">ÂèóË®™ËÄÖÊ≤íÈ†≠Ë∑Ø</span>&lt;/bdo&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
<div class="demolink"><a href="qa-ltr-scripts-in-rtl-data/eg_bidi" target="text">Test in your browser.</a></div>
</figure>
<p>If you need to mirror  the character glyphs, use a CSS transform, instead of overriding the direction.</p>
<figure class="example">
<p><code>bdo { transform: rotateY(180deg); display: inline-block; }</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;p&gt;The text &lt;span lang=&quot;ber&quot;&gt;<span lang="ber">‚¥∞‚µô‚µâ‚¥π‚µ¢‚¥∞‚µô‚µ∞</span>&lt;/span&gt; was originally written like this: &lt;bdo lang=&quot;ber&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;<span lang="ber">‚¥∞‚µô‚µâ‚¥π‚µ¢‚¥∞‚µô‚µ∞</span>&lt;/bdo&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
<div class="demolink"><a href="qa-ltr-scripts-in-rtl-data/eg_mirrored" target="text">Test in your browser.</a></div>
</figure>
<p>You may need a special font for Japanese punctuation.</p>

<h2 id="use_cases">Use cases</h2>

<p>Use cases are very few. You may very rarely come across modern Taiwanese or Tuareg text that writes right-to-left, but mostly the use cases come down to reproducing archaic usage of  scripts.</p>
<p>In the case of Chinese and Japanese, most of the modern text fragments you will come across are short, and are often designed to evoke archaic writing, such as in evocation of old Japan for tourists.</p>

<p>In the case of Japanese, an interesting <a href="https://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/right-to-left.html">article from the sci.lang.japan site</a> explains that, until the Meiji period, text was normally vertical except where there were spatial constraints, and the adoption of horizontal writing as a serious alternative to vertical led to experimentation with inline character direction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the very beginning of the change to yokogaki [horizontal writing], in the Meiji period (1868-1912), there was a short-lived form called migi yokogaki (<span lang="ja">Âè≥Ê®™Êõ∏„Åç</span>), "right yokogaki", in contrast to hidari yokogaki (<span lang="ja">Â∑¶Ê®™Êõ∏„Åç</span>), "left yokogaki", the current form. This resembled the right-to-left horizontal writing style of languages such as Arabic or Hebrew with line breaks on the left hand side of the page. ... This form was never widely used, and has not survived.</p></blockquote>
<p>The following picture is from a Taiwanese newspaper dating from around the year 2000.  This is very rare now. Notice that the horizontal title text in the middle-right runs right-to-left ‚Äì ie. in the same direction as the lines below the title flow ‚Äì but that it also includes a percentage which is written left-to-right. Notice also that the text in the caption under the picture, which occupies multiple lines (not aligned to a grid), is also read right-to-left.</p>

<div class="figWrap">

<figcaption>Part of a Taiwanese newspaper, with RTL horizontal text used for titles and figure captions.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and other archaic scripts are generally written in modern expository text from left-to-right. However, the original incriptions or written sources often ran right-to-left. The direction of hieroglyphs on monuments was determined by the overall aesthetic scheme. Alongside a picture of a person, you would read horizontal sequences of hieroglyphs towards the face of that person. Not only that, but the character glyphs would be mirrored, so that you would read towards the face or beginning of any character glyphs too.</p>
<p>Thus the sequence that modern egyptologists might write as </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="qa-ltr-scripts-in-rtl-data/egyptian-ltr.png" alt="ìÖììÇ§ìé°ìèèìè¶ìÄ≠"/></p>
<p>would be  ordered from right-to-left in the original and the glyphs would be mirrored.</p>

<p>You wouldn't normally need to, but we'll look here at how you could make the text look like the original if you wanted to.</p>

  <h3 id="bdo">Using <code class="kw" translate="no">bdo</code> to make text run RTL</h3>
    <figure class="example">
<p><code>p[lang=zh-hant] { text-align: right; }</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;p lang=&quot;zh-hant&quot;&gt;&lt;bdo dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;<span lang="zh-hant">Êú¨ÂúüÂåñ ÂèçÊàêÂúãÈöõÂåñÂç±Ê©ü</span>&lt;/bdo&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
<div class="demolink"><a href="qa-ltr-scripts-in-rtl-data/eg_simple" target="text">Test in your browser.</a></div>
</figure>
<p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">bdo</code> element (short for bidirectional override) suspends the automatic algorithms of the Unicode bidirectional algorithm and orders characters exactly as they are in memory. The <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> attribute is required, and indicates the direction in which the characters should be sequenced on display. We set its value to <code class="kw" translate="no">rtl</code>.</p>
<p>This makes <span lang="zh-hant">Êú¨ÂúüÂåñ ÂèçÊàêÂúãÈöõÂåñÂç±Ê©ü</span> display as 
<bdo dir="rtl" lang="zh-hant">Êú¨ÂúüÂåñ ÂèçÊàêÂúãÈöõÂåñÂç±Ê©ü</bdo>
.</p>
<p>If you are adding text inine, you're done at this point. However, if you want the text to start on the right side of a line you'll need to add some CSS to make that happen. Here we add <code translate="no">text-align: right</code>.</p>
<p>Note that we aren't using CSS properties to apply the direction. This is consistent with normal practice when dealing with right-to-left text in HTML. The markup in HTML is designed to provide you with what is needed, and can produce the needed effect without the CSS style sheet. </p>
</section>




  <section>
  <h3 id="bidirection">Managing bidirectional text</h3>
<figure class="example">
<p><code>p[lang=zh-hant] { text-align: right; }</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;p lang=&quot;zh-hant&quot;&gt;&lt;bdo dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;&lt;bdo dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;8.6%&lt;/bdo&gt;<span lang="zh-hant">ÂèóË®™ËÄÖÊ≤íÈ†≠Ë∑Ø</span>&lt;/bdo&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
<div class="demolink"><a href="qa-ltr-scripts-in-rtl-data/eg_bidi" target="text">Test in your browser.</a></div>
</figure>
<p>This is the title from the Taiwanese page above. It contains a percentage that needs to run left-to-right within the RTL flow. To make this happen we wrap the left-to-right content in another <code class="kw" translate="no">bdo</code> element and set the <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> attribute to <code class="kw" translate="no">ltr</code>.</p>
<p>This is actually fairly similar to the way markup is used for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew.  We recommend wrapping all opposite-direction text in markup with a <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> attribute for those languages. The markup also isolates the embedded text, protecting it from <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics.en#isolation">spillover effects</a> related to the surrounding context.</p>
<p>It is worth observing, at this point, that the text is still perfectly searchable, can be read by a voice browser, etc. etc. because we haven't disturbed the natural order of the characters in memory. A visual encoding approach, where characters are typed in reverse order, would break that.</p>
</section>




  <section>
  <h3 id="mirroring">Mirroring characters</h3>
<figure class="example">
<p><code>bdo { transform: rotateY(180deg); display: inline-block; }</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;p&gt;The text &lt;span lang=&quot;ber&quot;&gt;<span lang="ber">‚¥∞‚µô‚µâ‚¥π‚µ¢‚¥∞‚µô‚µ∞</span>&lt;/span&gt; was originally written like this: &lt;bdo lang=&quot;ber&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;<span lang="ber">‚¥∞‚µô‚µâ‚¥π‚µ¢‚¥∞‚µô‚µ∞</span>&lt;/bdo&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
<div class="demolink"><a href="qa-ltr-scripts-in-rtl-data/eg_mirrored" target="text">Test in your browser.</a></div>
</figure>
<p>This mirrors characters at the same time as ordering from right-to-left. It relates to the Egyptian example we saw earlier, but in this case we are using some Berber text, from the other side of North Africa.</p>
<p>Notice here  that our <code class="kw" translate="no">bdo</code> element has the <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> attribute set to <code class="kw" translate="no">ltr</code>, not <code class="kw" translate="no">rtl</code>. In fact, we don't strictly need a <code class="kw" translate="no">bdo</code> element at all. A <code class="kw" translate="no">span</code> would also do, so long as we add a class or id so that the styling can recognise it.</p>
<p>This approach may become a little tricky if there were embedded digits or such that flow in a LTR direction, but in the texts where we need to mirror the characters that is extremely unlikely.</p>
</section>




<section>
<h3 id="punctuation">Problems with punctuation</h3>
<p>You may have a problem if punctuation marks need to be mirrored in right-to-left arrangements. You would have to wrap them in markup and apply a transform.</p>
<p>Let's take the example of the comma. Old samples of Japanese indicate that the shape of the comma doesn't change from that of the modern comma. However, the position of the comma in the character square does change ‚Äì moving from bottom-left to bottom-right. This is particularly tricky, given that we can't achieve the change by applying the CSS transform (because we don't want to change the shape). It may be that we would need a special font to handle this.</p>

<figure id="comma">
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; font-family: serif;">
<div style="display: inline-block; height:2em; width:1.4em;background-color: antiquewhite; color:brown; font-size: 2em; text-align: left; margin-right: 1em; padding: 0 .3em;">,</div>
<div style="display: inline-block; height:2em; width:1.4em;background-color: antiquewhite; color:brown; font-size: 2em; text-align: right; margin-left: 1em; padding: 0 .3em;">,</div></div>
<figcaption>Position of a comma in the character space for LTR text (left), and RTL text (right).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's a strong likelihood, however, that  text which is written right-to-left in the way we describe will be short items, where punctuation doesn't appear.</p>
