  <h2 id="answer"><a href="#answer">Answer</a></h2>
  <p>Normalization is something you need to be aware of if you are authoring HTML pages with CSS style sheets in UTF-8 (or any other Unicode encoding), particularly if you are dealing with text in a  script that uses accents or other diacritics. </p>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="n11nwhat"><a href="#n11nwhat">What are normalization forms?</a></h3>
    <p>In Unicode it is possible to produce the same text with different sequences of characters. For example, take the Hungarian word <span class="qterm">világ</span>. The fourth letter could be stored in memory as a <dfn>precomposed</dfn> U+00E1   LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE (a single character) or as a <dfn>decomposed</dfn> sequence of U+0061   LATIN SMALL LETTER A followed by U+0301   COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (two characters). </p>
    <p><img src="qa-html-css-normalization-data/vilag.png" alt=" " /></p>
    <p>The Unicode Standard allows either of these alternatives, but requires that both  be treated as identical. To improve efficiency, an application will usually <dfn>normalize</dfn> text before performing searches or comparisons. Normalization, in this case, means converting the text to use all precomposed or all decomposed characters.</p>
    <p>There are four <dfn>normalization forms</dfn> specified by the Unicode Standard: NFC, NFD, NFKC and NFKD. The <span class="qchar">C</span> stands for (pre-)composed, and the <span class="qchar">D</span> for decomposed. The <span class="qchar">K</span> stands for compatibility. To improve interoperability, the W3C recommends the use of <strong>NFC</strong> normalized text on the Web.</p>

    <h3 id="n11nhow"><a href="#n11nhow">What do I need to know about normalization?</a></h3>
    <p style="">Unfortunately, normalization doesn't always take place before content is compared. A particularly important case is the use of selectors and class names or ids in HTML and CSS. If the word <span class="qterm">világ</span> is used in precomposed form in the HTML (eg. <code>&lt;span class=&quot;világ&quot;&gt;</code>), but in decomposed form in the CSS (eg. <code>.vila&#x0301;g { font-style: italic; }</code>), then the selector won't match the class name.</p>
    <p style="">What this means is that when producing content you should ensure that selectors and class or id names are character-for-character the same. This is particularly likely to be a  issue if the markup and the CSS are being authored or maintained by different people.</p>
    <p style="">The best way to ensure that these match is to use one particular Unicode normalization form for all authored content. As we said above, the W3C recommends NFC.</p>
    <p style="">Most keyboards for European languages output text in NFC already, but this is less likely to be the case if dealing with many non-European languages.</p>
    <p style="">In some cases your editor may allow you to save data in a choice of normalization forms. The picture below shows  an option for setting a particular normalization form as the default when opening new files in Dreamweaver (NFC is selected). You are shown a similar choice when saving a document.</p>
    <p style=""><img src="qa-html-css-normalization-data/dwprefs-nfc.png" alt="Unicode normalization form preferences on a dialog panel, showing NFC selected." /></p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="checking"><a href="#checking">How can I check pages for problems?</a></h3>
    <p style="">You can find out whether an HTML page contains  class names and id values that are not normalized according to NFC by using the <a class="print" href="http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/">W3C Internationalization Checker</a>.</p>
    <p style="">If you do have problems, you should find an editor or conversion tool that allows you to specify the normalization form, and use that to re-save your page.</p>
