<p>Unicode normalization is something you need to be aware of if you are authoring HTML pages with CSS style sheets in UTF-8 (or any other Unicode encoding), particularly if you are dealing with text in a  script that uses accents or other diacritics.</p>
<p>This page addresses the question:<br>
<span class="question">What is Unicode Normalization, and why do I need to know about it when creating HTML and CSS content?</span></p>





<section id="n11nwhat">
<h2>What is Unicode normalization?</h2>

<p>In Unicode-encoded content it is possible to produce the same text with different sequences of characters. For example, take the Hungarian word <span class="qterm">világ</span>. The fourth letter could be stored in memory as a <dfn>precomposed</dfn> (single) code point <span class="uname">U+00E1 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE</span> or as a <dfn>decomposed</dfn> sequence of <span class="uname">U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A</span> followed by <span class="uname">U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT</span> (two code points). </p>

<p><img src="qa-html-css-normalization-data/vilag.png" alt=" " /></p>

<p>The Unicode Standard allows either of these alternatives, but requires that both  be treated as identical by applications (ie. they are 'canonically equivalent'). To improve effectiveness, an application will usually <dfn>normalize</dfn> text before performing searches or comparisons. Normalization, in this particular case, means converting the text to use all precomposed or all decomposed characters. </p>

<p>Four <dfn>normalization forms</dfn> are specified by the Unicode Standard: NFC, NFD, NFKC and NFKD. The <span class="qchar">C</span> stands for (pre-)composed, and the <span class="qchar">D</span> for decomposed. The <span class="qchar">K</span> stands for compatibility. </p>
<p><span class="leadin">NFD</span> uses Unicode rules to maximally decompose a code point into component parts. For example, the Vietnamese letter <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><bdi lang="vi">&#x1EC1;</bdi> [<span class="uname">U+1EC1 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX AND GRAVE</span>]</span> becomes the sequence <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><bdi lang="vi">&#x0065;&#x0302;&#x0300;</bdi> [<span class="uname">U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E</span> + <span class="uname">U+0302 COMBINING CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT</span> + <span class="uname">U+0300 COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT</span>]</span>.</p>
<p><span class="leadin">NFC</span> runs that process in reverse, and will also completely compose partially decomposed sequences. However, this composition process is only applied to a subset of the Unicode repertoire. For example, the sequence <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><bdi lang="en">&#x0067;&#x0300;</bdi> [<span class="uname">U+0067 LATIN SMALL LETTER G</span> + <span class="uname">U+0300 COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT</span>]</span> has no precomposed form, and is unaffected by normalization.</p>
<p><span class="leadin">NFKC and NFKD</span> were intially introduced to provide round-trip compatibility with other character sets. This applies to code points that represent such things as glyph variants, shaped forms, alternative compositions, and so on, that can also be represented by other ‘canonical’ code points already in Unicode.  NFKD and NFKC normalization  replaces these code points with canonical characters or character sequences, and you cannot convert back to the original code points.  In principle, such compatibility variants should not be used.</p>

<h2>What do I need to know about normalization?</h2>

<section id="choosing">
<h3>Choosing a normalization form</h3>

<p>Natural language content aimed at human consumption does not need to all be in one normalized form – there may sometimes be good reasons to mix normalized forms. Applications that try to match one piece of text with another should, however, compare normalized versions of both.</p>

<p style="">Unfortunately, normalization doesn't always take place before content is compared, and a particularly important case is when CSS selectors are compared with HTML class names or ids, as style is applied to a page. If the word <span class="qterm">világ</span> is used in precomposed form in the HTML (eg. <code>&lt;span class=&quot;világ&quot;&gt;</code>), but in decomposed form in the CSS (eg. <code>.vila&#x0301;g { font-style: italic; }</code>), then the selector won't match the class name.</p>

<p style="">The following example shows this. The CSS selector is decomposed, whereas one class name in the HTML is decomposed and the other precomposed. As you should be able to see, only the decomposed class name is matched to the style. But notice also that it is not possible to distinguish the two forms in the source text.</p>

<figure id="fig_nonmatching" class="example" lang="hu">
<pre>CSS: <code class="language-css">.vila&#x0301;g { font-style: italic; }</code></pre>
<pre>HTML: <code class="language-html">&lt;span class=&quot;világ&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vila&#x0301;g&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
</figure>

<style>.vila\0301 g { font-style: italic; }</style>
<div id="out_bopomofo_position" class="browser_output">
<p class="browser_output_title">Output in your browser:</p>
<div style="display:flex; flex-direction:row; width:100%; justify-content:space-around;">
<p lang="hu" class="világ" style="font-size: 2rem;">word</p>
<p lang="hu" class="vila&#x0301;g" style="font-size: 2rem;">word</p>
</div>
</div>

<p style="">This means that when creating content you should ensure that selectors and class or id names are character-for-character the same. This is particularly likely to be a  issue if the markup and the CSS are being authored or maintained by different people.</p>

<p style="">The best way to ensure that these match is to use one particular Unicode normalization form for all syntactic constructs, and as the default for all authored content. It doesn't really matter whether you use the NFC or NFD normalization form, it's more important that you are consistent. NFC is, however, a good recommendation because this is what many (but not all) keyboards tend to produce. (Most keyboards for European languages output text in NFC already, but this is less likely to be the case if dealing with many non-European languages.)</p>
<p style="">We don't recommend using any of the K forms in this way.</p>
</section>




<section id="converting">
<h3>Converting the normalization form of a page</h3>

<p style="">You should also try to avoid automatically converting content from one normalization form to another, as it may obliterate some important code point distinctions, such as in the carefully crafted examples of <span lang="hu" class="qterm">világ</span> above, or in filenames or URLs, or text included in the page from elsewhere, etc.</p>
<p style="">It may also introduce a security risk, especially in code syntax. For example, the following code points are canonically equivalent: <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><bdi lang="en">&#x003E;&#x0338;</bdi> [<span class="uname">U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN</span> + <span class="uname">U+0338 COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY</span>]</span> and <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><bdi lang="en">&#x226F;</bdi> [<span class="uname">U+226F NOT GREATER-THAN</span>]</span>. Therefore source code in XML such as <code>&lt;character&gt;&#x0338;&lt;/character&gt;</code> can be corrupted by normalising to NFC.</p>
</section>







<section id="editors">
<h3>Normalization settings in your editor</h3>

<p style="">In some cases your editor may allow you to save data in a choice of normalization forms. The picture below shows  an option for setting a particular normalization form as the default when opening new files in Dreamweaver (NFC is selected). You are shown a similar choice when saving a document.</p>

<p style=""><img src="qa-html-css-normalization-data/dwprefs-nfc.png" alt="Unicode normalization form preferences on a dialog panel, showing NFC selected." /></p>

<p style="">If you have set up your editing environment like this, you may find yourself in a situation where you want to deviate from the default normalisation form, for instance to create the examples above. However, as soon as you save the file, it will obliterate those carefully implemented variant forms. A way around this is to use character escapes. If you write the word <span lang="hu" class="qterm">világ</span> in your source code as <code translate="no">vila&amp;#x0301;g</code> it will not be normalized during the save.</p>
</section>





<section id="checking">
<h3>How can I check pages for problems?</h3>

<p style="">You can find out whether an HTML page contains  class names and id values that are not normalized according to NFC by using the <a class="print" href="http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/">W3C Internationalization Checker</a>. (Look for the row <samp>Markup / Non-NFC class or id names</samp>.)</p>
