  <h2 id="question"><a href="#question">Question</a></h2>
    <p class="question">What are the best practices for using pull-down menus based on the <span class="kw" translate="no">select</span> element to direct
      visitors to localized content?</p>

  <p>As companies and organizations launch an increasing number of localized Web sites, user-friendly global navigation grows in
    importance.</p>
  <p>One of the more popular devices is a pull-down menu on the home page using the <span class="kw" translate="no">select</span> element that includes links
    to localized versions of the content. Such selection lists are not restricted to use on the home page, but may also be seen as a space-effective way
    of allowing users to switch between translations or regionally localized sites on a page by page basis. </p>
  <p>The localized content pointed to may be an alternative country site, a translated version of a site or page, etc. In this article we
    avoid discussing the best way to organize the information (ie. translated vs. region-specific sites) in order to concentrate on the pros and cons and
    best practice associated with using <em>selection lists</em> to choose the content. There are numerous other aspects to global navigation that will
    be described in other articles. </p>
  <p>Note that these recommendations do not apply to selection lists that are part of a form. For example, if you are filling in a form and
    selecting your country of residence or language from a list, then the selection list should be all in the language of the current page.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2 id="proscons"><a href="#proscons">Should I use a <code class="kw" translate="no">select</code> list at all?</a></h2>
  <p>Pull-downs can appear very attractive where space is at a premium. However, the pull-down menu is not always the best solution for
    global navigation and you need to decide whether it is the best solution for your Web site. The following points may help.</p>
  <p>The key advantage of using pull-downs is to fit the selection into a smaller space. </p>
  <p>Key disadvantages of using <span class="kw" translate="no">select</span> for links to localized pages or sites are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> users cannot see or access the links straight away </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> it is hard to find a label for the list that is not language-specific </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> users may not have fonts for all the option text, and graphics cannot be used instead of text </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If your site supports only a handful of localized versions, it is probably better to avoid using a pull-down menu altogether and
    simply include links directly on the page. This gives you more flexibility to use graphics to represent foreign text, avoids the difficulty of
    finding a suitable non-linguistic label for the list, and allows users to recognize the presence of and link to a page much more quickly. </p>
  <p>There are other techniques, too. For example, outline maps can be used to select region- or country-based local sites. </p>
  <p>If your pull-down points to more than 20 other sites or pages you should consider whether this is usable for those Web users who must
    scroll to the end of the list. If not, you may consider linking to a dedicated global gateway page at the home page level. If linking between
    localized versions of specific pages, a selection page may not be a practical solution. </p>

<section>
  <h2 id="bestpractise"><a href="#bestpractise">Best practices</a></h2>
  <p>If you do decide to use a pull-down menu, here are some best practices to keep in mind. </p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="location"><a href="#location">Location</a></h3>
    <p>
      <mark>Locate the pull-down menu at or near the top of the page.</mark>
      This location is highly visible, increasing the
      likelihood that the visitor will see it. Scanning studies for pages in left-to-right scripts show that positioning to the top right increases
      visibility. Furthermore, an increasing number of Web sites have located their global gateways in this location, conditioning Web users to come to
      expect it here. </p>
    <p>Certainly avoid putting the list at the bottom of the page so that it doesn't appear in the first screenful of information (and bear
      in mind that one screenful can be a different amount for different users).</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="labeling"><a href="#labeling">List label</a></h3>
    <p>
      <mark>Use a recognizable image alongside the pull-down menu to indicate that it is a control which will take the user to localized pages. Do not use text.</mark>
    </p>
    <p>You cannot expect Web users who
      are not fluent in English to understand "Select language". Universally recognized icons communicate to people regardless of what language they speak.
      In an ideal world there would be a widely recognized symbol for this. That time is still not here, though globe icons seem to be becoming more
      popular. </p>
    <p>Examples of possible graphics would include globes, iconic facial profiles with lines to indicate speech, alphabetic characters from
      multiple scripts (especially for links to translations), etc. </p>
    <p>The alt text for such a graphic doesn't have a great deal of importance. You may think that it needs to be in all languages, or no
      particular language, for accessibility, but in reality people reliant on screen readers would be able to traverse the pull-down text to find the
      right link. </p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="size"><a href="#size">The <span class="kw" translate="no">size</span> attribute</a></h3>
    <p>
      <mark>Consider using the <code class="kw" translate="no">size</code> attribute to display the first set of options in a select control.</mark>
    </p>
    <p>In some cases it may be effective to use the <span class="kw" translate="no">size</span> attribute to
      display the first set of options in the list – particularly if this is a long list. This suggests to the user that this is a collection of
      languages/regions, and may remove the need for a non-language-specific label for the list. Here is an example: </p>
    <figure> <img src="qa-navigation-select-data/select-size-attr.gif" alt="A pulldown list showing the first five selections." title="A pulldown list showing the first five selections." /> </figure>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="translate"><a href="#translate">Translations</a></h3>
    <p>
      <mark>Translate the menu options into the target language.</mark>
    </p>
    <p> Instead of including a link on the pull-down
      menu to a translation that reads, for example, "French" the link should read "<span lang="fr">français</span>"; and instead of a link
      to an alternative country site like "Germany" the link should read "Deutschland". </p>
    <p>Pay attention to capitalization rules in other languages. Note how the correct translation of "French" is "<span lang="fr">français</span>" with a lowercase 'f'. On the other hand, it is sometimes preferred to ignore this practice in favour of consistent casing, for purely stylistic reasons (see for example the top of this page, or Wikipedia's language links).</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="encoding"><a href="#encoding">Encoding</a></h3>
    <p>To display a mix of non-Latin languages, such as Arabic, Russian and Japanese, you will need a way to
      represent all the required characters. </p>
    <p>You should
      <mark class="requirement"><a href="/International/questions/qa-choosing-encodings">always use UTF-8 (Unicode)</a> as the encoding for your page</mark>
      , since this encoding supports all the characters you will need. </p>
    <p>If you really cannot use UTF-8, then you should use <a href="/International/questions/qa-escapes">escapes</a> to represent characters that are not supported
      by the encoding of your page. </p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="fonts"><a href="#fonts">Fonts</a></h3>
    <p>
      <mark class="requirement"> Decide whether it is a problem that a user won't have fonts for all the list items or menu options. If it is, use javascript menus or some other graphic-based approach.</mark>
    </p>
    <p> Be aware that a
      Web user in France, for example, may see empty boxes (so-called 'tofu') in place of the Japanese text, while a user in Japan will see the text just fine. This is because
      the fonts available on the French user's system may not contain Japanese glyphs. One could argue that this is not too important, since French users
      don't need to be able to read the Japanese. On the other hand, you may feel that empty boxes are unsightly. </p>
    <p>If you feel that empty boxes are unsightly you may be tempted to use text in graphics for non-Latin options. Unfortunately, it is not
      possible to include graphics in the selection list itself, but some sites add such graphics outside the pull-down menu. </p>
    <p>For example: </p>
    <figure> <img src="qa-navigation-select-data/select-non-latin-outside.gif" alt="A pulldown list with non-Latin selections displayed alongside." title="A pulldown list with non-Latin selections displayed alongside." /> </figure>
    <p>Be warned, however, that addressing non-Latin text this way may still not solve all problems. Certain accented Latin characters, such
      as those in '<span lang="cs">čeština</span>' may produce the same effect for some users who have Latin fonts that only cover Western
      European languages. </p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="descriptions"><a href="#descriptions">Descriptions</a></h3>
    <p>
      <mark>Decide whether to add a description alongside each option, using the language of the current page, so that users can tell what the native word means.</mark>
    </p>
    <p>For example: </p>
    <figure><span lang="cs">čeština</span> (Czech)<br />
      <span lang="fr">français</span> (French)<br />
      <span
					lang="de">deutsch</span> (German)<br />
      <span lang="ja">日本語</span> (Japanese)</figure>
    <p>This approach is not always necessary or desirable. On the other hand users may feel more comfortable with missing font glyphs if they
      see</p>
    <figure>⬜⬜⬜ (Japanese)</figure>
    <p>Using parentheses is useful because it shows more clearly that this is a clarification. </p>
    <p>Note, also, that names in the language of the current page should really be translated for every page where they appear – if you leave
      them in English it may give the wrong message. </p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="order"><a href="#order">Ordering</a></h3>
    <p>You will need to
      <mark class="requirement">find the most appropriate way of ordering the list of options</mark>
      , given that this is a multilingual list of language or country names. Ordering multilingual lists is not an
      issue that is specific to selection lists, and there is no simple answer to this.</p>
    <p>It is difficult to apply alphabetic ordering since this varies by language, and there are also likely to be multiple scripts involved.
      It would be possible to follow the default order prescribed by the Unicode Collation Algorithm, but whether that would be helpful, intuitive or
      recognizable to the user is another question.</p>
    <p>Other possibilities are to order the list by the size of your market, the size of the region or number of speakers of a language, or
      by some kind of geographical principle. Again, while these may provide a rationale for ordering, none of these approaches are necessarily helpful to
      the user – especially for long lists.</p>
    <p>This page and Wikipedia list language alternatives by (English) alphabetic order of the associated language tags. So, for example, German (de) comes before English (en), and Spanish (es) would come before French (fr). This works best when the user can  find his language easily by scanning. For a long list, this may be less appropriate, since the user must not only know the tag for their language but,  in order to anticipate its likely position in the list, must also be able to guess  that  tags have been used as the basis for the ordering.</p>

  <h2 id="bytheway"><a href="#bytheway">By the way</a></h2>
  <p>You should not consider automatic content negotiation to be a replacement for providing links on a page. It always makes sense to provide
    in-page links for occasions when things don't work out as expected. </p>
  <p>This article is specifically focused on the use of the <span class="kw" translate="no">select</span> element. Some designers may prefer to use
    JavaScript to simulate pull-down lists. This can help in that you are not limited to text; you can use text in graphics to avoid font issues. There
    are, of course, other potential problems associated with the use of JavaScript. </p>
