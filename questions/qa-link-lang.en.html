    <h3 id="proscons"><a href="#proscons">Pros and cons</a></h3>
    <p>If a visitor to a web page follows a link, only to find out that they cannot read the target document, this wastes time and, if it happens enough, introduces fatigue. Eventually they may  lack confidence when faced with links that actually do go to  pages they can read.</p>
    <p>If you add some text or graphic to the link indicating that the target document is in another language, it may allow the reader to decide in advance whether or not to follow the link, according to their language skill, and therefore avoid these problems.</p>
    <p>There are, however, potential problems with this approach if a newly translated version of the target document  becomes available at a later date. </p>
    <p>Assume, for example that a French page has used this approach some time ago to point to a second page which at that time was only available in English. Later, the target page is translated into French. Unless the first French page  is updated, it will now be incorrectly warning French readers that the second page is in English, and possibly discouraging them from following a link to what is now actually a perfectly legible document.</p>
    <p>You also need to consider how to communicate to the reader whether the target document is available in other languages. For example, if the user is reading a page in Hungarian, and the link goes to information that is not  available in Hungarian, but is available in both English and German, what do you signal to the reader? It may be that the reader would prefer the German version over the English, or vice versa. This gets more problematic the greater the number of alternative translations available.</p>
    <p>You need to assess these pros or cons when deciding whether or not to mark links in this way.</p>

    <h3 id="hreflang"><a href="#hreflang">Using hreflang with CSS to indicate the language</a></h3>
    <p>If you do decide that you  want to indicate the language of a resource at the end of a link, one  way people have done this in the past is to use an <code class="kw" translate="no">hreflang</code> attribute and some CSS to provide the information to the reader.</p>
    <p>In HTML, the <code class="kw" translate="no">hreflang</code> attribute on an <code class="kw" translate="no">a</code> element is supposed to indicate the language of the document at the other end of the link. Note that the <a class="print" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#attr-hyperlink-hreflang">HTML spec says</a> that <code class="kw" translate="no">hreflang</code> information  should not be used by the browser to affect the choice of language version.  When fetching the resource, browsers must use only language information associated with the resource to determine its language, not metadata included in the link to the resource.</p>
    <p>Taking into account the pros and cons mentioned earlier, <code class="kw" translate="no">hreflang</code> could provide a means of indicating to the reader the language of the resource at the end of the link for simple cases. However, there are also significant problems.</p>
    <p>For instance, if a resource is available in multiple languages via <a class="print" href="/International/questions/qa-when-lang-neg">server-side content negotiation</a>, it is not possible to express the range of languages that are available, since the <code class="kw" translate="no">hreflang</code> attribute accepts only a single language as its value.</p>
    <h4 id="hreflangimplementation">Implementation details</h4>
    <p>Here is an example of how <code class="kw" translate="no">hreflang</code> has been used in the past. The following content has a link that points to a page in Swedish.</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <p>There is also a page describing <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/serving-xhtml/index.sv">why a DOCTYPE is useful</a><sup style="color:#999;"> [sv]</sup>.</p>
    </figure>
	<p>You could achieve this with the following markup:</p>
    <figure class="example"><code>&lt;p&gt;There is also a page describing &lt;a href=&quot;swedish-doc.html&quot; hreflang=&quot;sv&quot;&gt;why a DOCTYPE is useful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></figure>
    <p>The code to enable this in CSS may be something like:</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <pre>a[hreflang]:after { 
    content: &quot; [&quot; attr(hreflang) &quot;]&quot;; 
    color: #999;
    vertical-align: super;
    font-size: 70%;
    } </pre>
    <div class="demolink"><a href="qa-link-lang-data/sv" target="text">See live demo.</a></div>
    </figure>
    <p>For each <code class="kw" translate="no">a</code> element with an <code class="kw" translate="no">hreflang</code> attribute, the CSS adds the value of that attribute in square parentheses after the link. </p>
    <p>You could just as easily append text or even a graphic after the link by associating it with the <code class="kw" translate="no">content</code> property, rather than the <code class="kw" translate="no">attr(hreflang)</code>. This might be better if you are not sure that readers will recognize the ISO abbreviations.</p>
    <p>Here is the CSS. You would need style rules for each   language you are dealing with.</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <pre>a[hreflang]:after { 
    color: #999;
    vertical-align: super;
    font-size: 70%;
    }
a[hreflang = 'sv']:after { 
    content: &quot; [Swedish]&quot;; 
    }
a[hreflang = 'fi']:after { 
    content: " [Finnish]"; 
    } 
etc.</pre>
     <div class="demolink"><a href="qa-link-lang-data/swedish" target="text">See live demo.</a></div>
   </figure>
    <p>For Swedish, the displayed result would be:</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <p>There is also a page describing <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/serving-xhtml/index.sv">why a DOCTYPE is useful</a><sup style="color:#999;"> [Swedish]</sup>.</p>
    </figure>

    <h3 id="flags"><a href="#flags">Don't use flags to indicate languages!</a></h3>
    <p>Flags represent countries, not languages. </p>
    <p>Numerous countries use the same language as another country, and numerous countries have more than one official language. Flags don't map well onto these permutations. </p>
    <p>In addition, flags have nationalistic connotations that may be unwelcome for people of other countries, even though they speak the same language.</p>
    <p>While flags can be very appropriate for sites that are distinguished on the basis of region (eg. the amazon.co.uk site vs. the amazon.ca site), you should normally avoid them when dealing with links to  pages that are just translations.</p>
