    <p class="question">How do I use the MultiViews approach on an Apache Web server to automatically serve resources in the language
      requested by an HTTP request?</p>
  </section>


<section>
  <h2 id="background"><a href="#background">Background</a></h2>
  <p>When a user agent requests a document from a server, information about the user's language preferences is typically passed to the server
    via the HTTP Accept-Language header. If the server stores versions of a page in more than one language, this HTTP information can be used to retrieve
    the page in the user's preferred language, if it is available. If there is only one version of a page on the server, that version will be
    retrieved.</p>
  <p>The mechanism of choosing the relevant page to return to the user, based on the Accept-Language information in the HTTP request, is
    referred to as <dfn>language negotiation</dfn>.</p>
  <p> In many cases, the initial user agent setting is okay. For example, if you have a Japanese version of a browser, the browser typically
    assumes that you prefer pages in Japanese, and sends this information to the server. Mainstream browsers allow you to modify these language
    preferences. For more information see <a class="print" href="/International/questions/qa-lang-priorities"><cite>Setting language
    preferences in a browser</cite></a>.</p>
  <p>There are two different approaches to resource negotiation in Apache. The first involves the use of a <dfn>type map file</dfn> (i.e., a .var file)
    which names the files containing the variants explicitly; the second involves the use of a <dfn>'MultiViews'</dfn> search, where the server does an implicit
    filename pattern match and chooses from among the results. The MultiViews option can also be set on a per directory basis, if the server
    administrator has allowed it.</p>
  <p>This article addresses the question of how to set up the documents on an Apache server, using the MultiViews approach, so that language
    negotiation works.</p>

  <h2 id="answer"><a href="#answer">Answer</a></h2>
  <p>Note, first, that language negotiation may or may not be the best approach for serving your multilingual content to your readers. In some
    cases, for example, localized sites may be best maintained by keeping the translated versions of a page in language-specific directories, or by mixing
    the two approaches. Which approach is appropriate, and when, will be the topic of a future article.</p>
  <p>Setting up language negotiation involves</p>
  <ol>
    <li>developing a convention for naming the different language versions of your file,</li>
    <li>planning a fallback strategy to deal with requested languages that you don't support, and</li>
    <li>setting the appropriate server-side directives to make it all work.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There is more than one way to set up language negotiation on Apache servers, and the right approach will depend on the higher level
    settings and the privileges enabled or disabled by the server administrator. You may need to contact your server administrator to check which
    approach is available and what privileges you have.</p>
  <p>Given the number of ways in which server set up can vary, it is difficult to provide a simple definitive description of how to set up
    language negotiation. What follows is a description of a typical approach. We will assume that <code class="kw" translate="no">MultiViews</code> is enabled (the default) and
    that the user can change certain directives in <code class="kw" translate="no">.htaccess</code> files (small text files in the directory structure). <code class="kw" translate="no">AllowOverride</code> has to be properly set by the server administrator for the .htaccess file approach to work. You will need to check with your server administrator
    whether this approach is workable for your own circumstances.</p>
  <p>We will use the following example: a document called example.html is available in 3 languages, English, French and German, and the
    default is English. Although the example limits itself to .html files, language negotiation can be applied to other types of file.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="naming"><a href="#naming">File naming</a></h3>
    <p>Each language version is indicated by a special extension, which can appear before or after the .html extension. In practice, there
      are some considerations to bear in mind with regard to the placement of this extension.</p>
    <p>If you put the language extension last, the .html extension can be included or excluded when requesting the file. This strategy may,
      however, make it more difficult to read or edit the files if they are not on an Apache server (eg. read from another server, a CD, or a hard drive).
      This is because most editors and browsers just look at the last extension to determine what type of file this is and how to handle it. For our
      example the English, French and German files would be named, respectively, as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>example.html.en</li>
      <li>example.html.fr</li>
      <li>example.html.de</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you put the .html extension last you make it easier to to read or edit the files if they are not on an Apache server, but to access
      the resource on the Apache server the name must always be typed in a browser address bar or identified in a hyperlink, etc., <strong>without the
      extensions</strong> (eg. <code>&lt;a href="example"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code>). For our example, the filenames would be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>example.en.html</li>
      <li>example.fr.html</li>
      <li>example.de.html</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The language labels shown can actually be any strings, as long as you define their meaning on the server (see below). The server is
      likely to already recognize a number of 2-letter language extensions from global settings in its httpd.conf file. We recommend that you use ISO
      language and country codes in the way defined by <a class="print" href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt">BCP 47</a>, since this provides for greater
      consistency and easy recognition of language labels.</p>
    <p>You should be careful with a few extensions. For example, using the ISO code for Polish, .pl, would confuse it with the extension
      typically used to indicate Perl documents. You may therefore want to use pl-PL for Polish.</p>
    <p>Note that users can refer to a specific file by typing in the full file name, eg. example.fr.html will retrieve the French version,
      regardless of the user's language settings.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="directives"><a href="#directives">Server directives</a></h3>
    <p>You would normally use the <span class="kw"><a class="print" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_mime.html#addlanguage">AddLanguage</a></span> directive to
      specify which extension maps to which content language specified in the incoming HTTP.</p>
    <p>For example, the following directive maps the HTTP content language request for French to the extension .fr: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><code> AddLanguage fr .fr</code></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There are a number of places you can specify this. It may already be specified globally by an entry in the server's httpd.conf file,
      or a server administrator may add it there. Alternatively, a user uploading content might specify it in a file in the directory hierarchy. Such a
      file would typically be called <code class="kw" translate="no">.htaccess</code>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="defaults"><a href="#defaults">Default files</a></h3>
    <div class="sidenoteGroup">
      <p>It is important to specify a default file, since a user who doesn't have either English, French or German in their list of
        preferred languages (say for example a Spanish user), or who's user agent doesn't support content negotiation, would otherwise receive a HTTP 406
        result (NOT ACCEPTABLE) rather than a file.</p>
      <aside class="sideinfonote"><p class="info">Note also that some major browsers may set the user default to <code>en-us</code> for US users. This will not
        match against <code>en</code> on the server, so you should be sure you provide a way for them to reach an English document.</p></aside>
    </div>
    <p>The best way to specify a default file will vary, depending on whether your language extension precedes or follows the .html
      extension, and on what version of Apache you are using. In the examples below we will assume that the default is English (likely to often be the best
      choice for a default, given the widespread nature of English).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="specdef2"><a href="#specdef2">Specifying default files in Apache 2.0.30 and above</a></h3>
    <p>On versions 2.0.30 and above of the Apache server you can specify a default file quite cleanly using the <span class="kw"><a class="print" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_negotiation.html#forcelanguagepriority">ForceLanguagePriority</a></span> and <span class="kw"><a class="print" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_negotiation.html#languagepriority">LanguagePriority</a></span> directives (follow the links for
      detailed descriptions of how these directives work).</p>
    <p>Given our example above, we could set the default to be English using the following two lines:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><code> LanguagePriority en fr de</code><br />
        <code>ForceLanguagePriority Fallback</code></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now if a Spanish user were to request a Spanish document in the context of our example they would be served the English document
      instead, ie. the first item in the <code class="kw" translate="no">LanguagePriority</code> list.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="specdef1"><a href="#specdef1">Specifying default files in Apache 1.3.4 to 2.0.29</a></h3>
    <p>If your server version is earlier than 2.0.30 you will have to do a lot more work to specify the default file, since the <code class="kw" translate="no">ForceLanguagePriority</code> directive is not available. Also, the approach will depend on whether the language extension comes before or after the .html
      extension.</p>
    <p>First let's look at the case where your language extension comes before the .html extension (ie. the resource must always be typed in
      a browser address bar or identified in a hyperlink, etc., without the .html extension). To set the default to English you can create a copy of the
      English file in the directory with the following name:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>example.html</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If your language extension comes after the .html (ie. the .html extension can be included or excluded when requesting the file) you
      will need to name your copy of the English file:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>example.html.html</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The default file name ends in .html.html because if the default file were named example.html and the user requested the file as
      example.html no content negotiation would ever take place (because an exact match can be found).</p>

  <h2 id="bytheway"><a href="#bytheway">By the way</a></h2>
  <p>If there is only one file with a given name in a directory and it has no language extension, that will be served whatever the client's
    language preference.</p>
  <p>This technique can be applied to other types of file besides HTML. We just used an HTML example here because it is a common
    requirement.</p>
