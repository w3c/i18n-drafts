    <h2 id="quickanswer"><a href="#quickanswer">Quick answer</a></h2>
  <p>A character escape is a way of representing a character in source code using only ASCII characters. In HTML you can escape the euro sign <span class="qchar">€</span> in the following ways.</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
  <tr><th>Format</th><th>Name</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>&amp;#<code>x20AC</code>;</td>
    <td>hexadecimal numeric character reference</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&amp;#8364;</td>
    <td>decimal numeric character reference</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&amp;euro;</td>
    <td>named character reference</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
  <p>In CSS syntax you would use one of the following.</p>
  <table>
  <thead>
  <tr><th>Format</th>
  <th>Notes</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>\20AC </td>
    <td>must be followed by a space if the next character is one of a-f, A-F, 0-9</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\0020AC</td>
    <td>must be 6 digits long, no space needed (but can be included)</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>A trailing space is treated as part of the escape, so use 2 spaces if you actually want to follow the escaped character with a space. If using escapes in CSS identifiers, see the additional rules below.</p>
  <p>Because you should use UTF-8 for the character encoding of the page, you won't normally need to use character escapes. You may however find them useful to represent invisible or ambiguous characters, or characters that would otherwise interact in undesirable ways with the surrounding source code or text.</p>
  <p>For more details, see below.</p>

  <h2 id="answer"><a href="#answer">Character escapes in markup</a></h2>

    <p>You can use a <dfn>character escape</dfn> to represent any Unicode character in HTML, XHTML or XML using only ASCII characters. </p>
    <aside class="insideinfonote"><p class="info">Different specifications give different names  to these constructs. For example,  named character  references may be referred to as <dfn>character entity references</dfn>. We have chosen to use names for this article that  are used for HTML5.</p></aside>
    <p><dfn id="ncr">Numeric character references (NCRs)</dfn> and <dfn id="entity_ref">named character  references</dfn> are types of character escape used in  markup. For example, the following are different ways of  representing the character <span class="uname">U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE</span>.</p>
    <p>(The <span class="uname">NO-BREAK SPACE</span> character looks like a space but prevents a line wrap between the characters on either side. In French it is commonly used with punctuation such as colons and exclamation marks, which are preceded by a space but should not appear at the beginning of a line during text wrap.)</p>
    <div class="sidenoteGroup"> 
      <!--<p><span class="newterm">NCRs</span> (Numeric Character References) and <span class="newterm">character entities</span> are types of <span class="newterm">escape</span>, ie. ways of representing any Unicode character in XML or (X)HTML using only ASCII characters. For example, the following are different ways of representing the character <span class="uname">U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE</span>:</p>-->
      <dl>
        <dt><code>&amp;#xA0;</code></dt>
        <dd>A hexadecimal numeric character reference. All numeric character references begin with <code>&amp;#</code> and end with <code>;</code>. The <code>x</code> indicates that what follows is a hexadecimal number representing the code point value of a Unicode character. The hex number is not case-sensitive.
          <div class="example"><code lang="fr">&lt;p&gt;Vive la France&amp;#xA0;!&lt;/p&gt;</code></div>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>&amp;#160;</code></dt>
        <dd>A decimal numeric character reference. This uses a decimal number to represent the same Unicode code point.
          <div class="example"><code lang="fr">&lt;p&gt;Vive la France&amp;#160;!&lt;/p&gt;</code></div>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>&amp;nbsp;</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p style="margin-top:0;">A named character  reference. This is a very different type of escape. Named character references are defined in the markup language definition.     This means, for example, that for HTML only a specific range of characters (defined by the HTML specification) can be represented as named character  references (and that includes only a small subset of the Unicode range). </p>
          <p>Note that the  name is case sensitive: in HTML, <code>&amp;Aacute;</code> represents the <em>uppercase</em> letter <span class="qchar">Á</span>, whereas <code>&amp;aacute;</code> represents the <em>lowercase</em> <span class="qchar">á</span>.
          </p>
          <div class="example"><code lang="fr">&lt;p&gt;Vive la France&amp;nbsp;!&lt;/p&gt;</code></div>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <aside class="sideinfonote"><p class="warning">Some browsers allow you to omit the semicolon at the end of a numeric character reference, but this is not recommended, since it may lead to interoperability problems. Using the semicolon also avoids the potential problem of the end of the escape becoming undetectable when the escape is embedded in text.</p></aside>
    </div>
    
  <section>
    <h3 id="cpnumbers"><a href="#cpnumbers">Code point numbers</a></h3>
    <p>One point worth special note is that values of numeric character references (such as <code>&amp;#x20AC;</code> or <code>&amp;#8364;</code> for the euro sign <span class="qchar">€</span>) are interpreted as Unicode characters – <strong>no matter what encoding you use for your document</strong>. </p>
    <p>For example, the code point number of the euro sign in Windows code page 1252 is 80. It is a common error for people working on content in that encoding to represent the euro sign using <code>&amp;#x80;</code>. This HTML should actually produce a control character, since the escape would be expanded as the character at position 80 in the Unicode repertoire. (In fact, browsers tend to silently correct that particular error. See the <a class="print" href="/International/tests/repo/results/escapes#reallocated">test pages</a>.) </p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="cssescapes"><a href="#cssescapes">CSS escapes</a></h2>
    <p>CSS represents escaped characters in a different way. Escapes start with a backslash followed by the hexadecimal number that represents the character's <em>hexadecimal</em> Unicode code point value.</p>
    <p>If there is a following character that is not in the range A–F, a–f or 0–9, that is all you need. The following example represents the word <span class="qterm" lang="fr">émotion</span>.</p>
    <div class="sidenoteGroup">
    <div class="example"><code lang="fr">\E9motion</code></div>
    <aside class="sideinfonote">
    <p class="info">There is no actual need to escape the é in these examples. It's just for the purposes of illustration. The sequence of characters 'émotion' would also work fine. (See, however, the next subsection  for issues related to using digits at the start of an identifier.)</p>
    </aside>
    </div>
    <p>If, on the other hand, the next character is one that can be used in hexadecimal numbers, it won't be clear where the end of the number is. In these cases there are two options. The first is to use a space after the escape. This space is part of the escape syntax, and does not remain after the character escape is parsed. The following example shows how you could represent the word <span class="qterm"  lang="fr">édition</span> so that the <span class="qchar">d</span> is not assumed to be part of the escape.</p>
    <div class="example"><code lang="fr">\E9 dition</code></div>
    <p>Alternatively, you can use a 6-digit hexadecimal number, with or without a space. Here is an alternative way of writing <span class="qterm"  lang="fr">édition</span>.</p>
    <div class="example"><code lang="fr">\0000E9dition</code></div>
    <p> Because any white-space following the hexadecimal number is swallowed up as part of the escape,  if you actually want a space to appear after the escaped character you will need to add two spaces (after a hexadecimal number of any length).</p>
    
    
    <section>
    <h3 id="css_identifiers"><a href="#css_identifiers">Using escapes with CSS identifiers</a></h3>
    <p>Identifiers in CSS, such as class names in CSS selectors, can begin with - _  a-z or A-Z or a non-ASCII character, but <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#ident-token-diagram">cannot begin with any other ASCII character</a>. However,  escaped characters of any type can appear in any location.</p>
    <p>This means that you can't start an identifier with an ASCII digit 0-9 (although you <em>can</em> use digits after the first character). So if the class name you want to refer to happens to begin with a digit you will need to escape it.</p>
    <p>For example, to select an element in HTML with the class name &quot;123&quot;, you would write the following.</p>
    <div class="example"><code lang="fr">.\31 23 { ... }</code></div>
    <p>Note the use of the space to separate the escaped part of the class name from the remainder, so that it's clear where the end of the escape is. If you had written <code>\3123</code> this would represent ㄣ [<span class="uname">U+3123   BOPOMOFO LETTER EN</span>]. (You could also have written <code>\00003123</code>, since the CSS escape ends after the 6th character past the backslash.)</p>
    <p>There is no need to also escape the '23' part of the identifier, since digits are allowed after the first position.</p>
    </section>
    
    
    <section>
    <h3 id="css_other"><a href="#css_other">Sequences and backslashes</a></h3>
    <p>The following all show  valid ways of escaping a sequence of characters, such as those in the sequence of Egyptian hieroglyphs <img src="qa-escapes-data/egyptian.png" alt="𓌢𓅱𓀁"/>, meaning 'voice'.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p><code lang="fr">\13322\13171\13001</code></p>
      <p><code lang="fr">\13322 \13171 \13001</code></p>
      <p><code lang="fr">\013322\013171\013001</code></p>
      <p><code lang="fr">\013322 \013171 \013001</code></p>
    </div>
    <p>The backslash can also be used in CSS before a syntax character to prevent it being read as part of the code. For more information about CSS escapes, see the <a class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#escaping">CSS Syntax Module</a>.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="not"><a href="#not"> When not to use escapes</a></h2>
    <p>It is almost always preferable to use an encoding that allows you to represent  characters in their normal form, rather than using named character references or numeric character references.</p>
    <p>Using escapes can make it difficult to read and maintain source code, and can also significantly increase file size.</p>
    <p>Many English-speaking developers have the expectation that other languages only make occasional use of non-ASCII characters, but this is wrong.</p>
    <p>Take for example the following passage in Czech.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p lang="cs">Jako efektivnější se nám jeví pořádání tzv. Road Show prostřednictvím našich autorizovaných dealerů v   Čechách a na Moravě, které proběhnou v průběhu září a října.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If you were to require numeric character references for all non-ASCII characters, the passage would become unreadable, difficult to maintain and much longer. It would, of course, be much worse for a language that didn't use Latin characters at all.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p lang="cs">Jako efektivn&amp;#x115;j&amp;#x161;&amp;#xED; se n&amp;#xE1;m jev&amp;#xED;   po&amp;#x159;&amp;#xE1;d&amp;#xE1;n&amp;#xED; tzv. Road Show prost&amp;#x159;ednictv&amp;#xED;m na&amp;#x161;ich autorizovan&amp;#xFD;ch   dealer&amp;#x16F; v &amp;#x10C;ech&amp;#xE1;ch a na Morav&amp;#x11B;, kter&amp;#xE9; prob&amp;#x11B;hnou v pr&amp;#x16F;b&amp;#x11B;hu   z&amp;#xE1;&amp;#x159;&amp;#xED; a &amp;#x159;&amp;#xED;jna.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As we said before, use characters rather than escapes for ordinary text.</p>
    <p id="useinxhtml"><strong class="leadin">Use in XHTML.</strong> Using named character references in a document that is parsed as XML may become problematic if the entities are defined externally to your document and the tools that process the XML do not read the external files. In such cases the entity references will not be replaced by characters. For this reason, if you need to use escapes, it may be safer to use numeric character references, or define the character entities you need inside the document. </p>
    <p>If you use <a class="print" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#named-character-references">HTML-defined named character references </a> (such as <code translate="no">&amp;aacute;</code>) to represent characters in XHTML, you should take care any time your content is processed using XML parsers or other tools.</p>
</section>
  <section>
    <h2 id="use"><a href="#use">When  escapes</a> can be useful</h2>
    <p><strong class="leadin">Syntax characters.</strong> There are three characters that should always appear in content as escapes, so that they do not interact with the syntax of the markup. These are part of the language for all documents based on  HTML and for XML.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code>&amp;lt;</code> (&lt;)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>&amp;gt;</code> (&gt;)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>&amp;amp;</code> (&amp;)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may also want to represent the double-quote (") as <code>&amp;quot;</code> and the single quote (') as <code>&amp;apos;</code>. This would certainly be the case in attribute text when you need to use the same type of quotes as those that surround the attribute value. <!--Note, however, that, although it is part of the XML
					language, &amp;apos; is not defined in HTML 4.01 and some browsers do not support &amp;apos; in HTML. For this reason the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xhtml1-20020801/#C_16">XHTML
					specification</a> recommends instead the use of &amp;#39; if text may be passed to an HTML browser.--></p>
    <p id="invisible"><strong class="leadin">Invisible or ambiguous characters.</strong> A particularly useful role for escapes is to represent characters that are invisible or ambiguous in presentation. </p>
    <p>One example would be Unicode character <span class="uname">U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</span>. This character can be used to clarify directionality in bidirectional text (eg. when using the Arabic or Hebrew scripts). It has no graphic form, however, so it is difficult to see where these characters are in the text, and if they are lost or forgotten they could create unexpected results during later editing. Using <code>&amp;rlm;</code> (or its numeric character reference equivalent <code>&amp;#x200F;</code>) instead makes it very easy to spot these characters.</p>
    <p>An example of an ambiguous character is <span class="uname">U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE</span>. This type of space prevents line breaking, but it looks just like any other space when used as a character. Using <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> (or <code>&amp;#xA0;</code>) makes it quite clear where such spaces appear in the text.</p>
    <p><strong class="leadin">Input problems.</strong> If your editing tool does not allow you to easily enter needed characters you may also resort to using escapes. Note that this is not a long-term solution, nor one that works well if you have to enter a lot of such characters – it takes longer and makes maintenance more difficult. Ideally you would choose an editing tool that allowed you to enter these characters as characters. Alternatively, if you only need the occasional character, use a character map tool or <a class="print" href="http://r12a.github.io/pickers/">character picker</a>.</p>
    <p><strong class="leadin">Encoding gaps.</strong> Escapes can be useful to represent characters not supported by the encoding you choose for the document, for example, to represent Chinese characters in a document encoded as  Windows-1252. You should ask yourself first, however, why you have not changed the encoding of the document to UTF-8, which covers all the characters you need.</p>
  </section>
  
  
  
  
  <section>
    <h2 id="styleattr"><a href="#styleattr">Using escapes in style attributes</a></h2>
    <p>It is usually a good idea to put style information in an external style sheet or a <span class="kw">style</span> element in the head of an HTML  file. Occasionally, or perhaps on a temporary basis, you may use a <span class="kw">style</span> <em>attribute</em> on a particular element, instead. Even more rarely, you may want to represent one or more characters in the <span class="kw">style</span> attribute using character escapes.</p>
    <p>A <span class="kw">style</span> attribute in  HTML can represent characters using numeric or named character references or CSS escapes. On the other hand, the <span class="kw">style</span> <em>element</em> in HTML can contain neither numeric nor named character references, and the same applies to an external style sheet.</p>
    <p>Because there is a tendency to want to move styles declared in attributes to the style element or an external style sheet (for example, this might be done automatically using an application or script), it is safest to use only CSS escapes.</p>
    <p>For example, it is better to use</p>
    <div class="example">
      <pre>&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: L\FC beck&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
    </div>
    <p>than</p>
    <div class="example">
      <pre>&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: L&amp;#xFC;beck&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </section>



<section>
<h2 id="bytheway"><a href="#bytheway">By the way</a></h2>
  <p><strong class="leadin">Changing to UTF-8 means re-saving your file.</strong> Using the character encoding UTF-8 for your page means that you can avoid the
    need for most escapes and just work with characters. Note, however, that to change the encoding of your document, it is not enough to just change the encoding
    declaration at the top of the page or on the server. You need to re-save your document in that encoding. For help understanding how to do that with
    your application read <a class="print" href="/International/questions/qa-setting-encoding-in-applications"><cite>Setting encoding in web authoring applications</cite></a>.</p>
  <p><span class="leadin">Hex vs. decimal. </span>Typically when the Unicode Standard refers to or lists characters it does so using a hexadecimal value. For instance, the code point
    for the letter <span class="qchar">á</span> may be referred to as <span class="uname">U+00E1</span>. Given the prevalence of this convention, it is often useful, though not
    required, to use hexadecimal numeric values in escapes rather than decimal values. You do not need to use leading zeros in escapes, ie. <span class="qchar">á</span> could be represented as <code>&amp;#xE1;</code>.</p>
  <p id="suppchars"><span class="leadin">Supplementary characters. </span>Supplementary characters are those Unicode characters beyond the <a href="/International/articles/definitions-characters/#unicode" class="dfn print">Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)</a>. In UTF-16 a supplementary character is encoded using two 16-bit <dfn>surrogate code points</dfn> from the BMP. Because of
    this, or because of experience with older version s of JavaScript syntax, some people think that supplementary characters need to be represented using two escapes, but this is incorrect – you must use the single,
    code point value for that character. For example, use <code>&amp;#x233B4;</code> rather than <code>&amp;#xD84C;&amp;#xDFB4;</code>.</p>
  <p id="ampersands"><strong class="leadin">Single ampersands.</strong> Although HTML user agents have tended to turn a blind eye, you should never have a single ampersand (<span class="qchar">&amp;</span>) in your HTML document. You should pay particular attention to URIs that include parameters. For example, your document should contain <code>http://example.org/my-script.php?class=guest<span class="highlight">&amp;amp;</span>name=user</code>, rather than <code>http://example.org/my-script.php?class=guest<span class="highlight">&amp;</span>name=user</code>.</p>
