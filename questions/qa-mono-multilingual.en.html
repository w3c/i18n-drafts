 <h2>Question</h2>
    <p class="question">What are the trade-offs between international sites that are monolingual vs. multilingual?</p>
  </section>




<section id="answer">
<h2>Answer</h2>
  <p>An international Web site is one that presents information to an international audience. In addition to deciding between a monolingual
    vs. multilingual approach, you will also need to consider whether to change the <em>content</em> for your international readers.</p>
  <p>The approach you take will depend on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the type of material you are dealing with, eg. is it simple technical material or material that is meant to motivate or sell?</li>
    <li>your audience, eg. is it a well-defined group conforming to agreed standards, or general readership? </li>
    <li>your financial means and resources, eg. is the preferred approach achievable within budget, or simply too complex or costly to
      support your business case?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You should also consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>requirements for accessibility of the information, eg. can users understand without translation?</li>
    <li>desired impact on the reader, eg. are you attempting to motivate, persuade or entertain the reader?</li>
    <li>relevance or appropriateness to their situation, eg. do you have to consider different buying habits, prices, legal requirements, or
      other varying social conditions of the international audience?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Only you can decide which is the right approach for your circumstances. But you should do so after considering some of the ideas
    below.</p>
    
  <section id="msc">
    <h3><a href="#msc">Monolingual, same content</a></h3>
    <p>Web sites that present the same monolingual content to an international audience may be acceptable for a technical community with an
      agreed standard language. However it might still be useful to translate some types of information, such as tutorial and introductory text.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, a single language, same content Web site facing <em>customers or general readers</em> runs the risk of alienating
      those people, either because they don't understand the information, because they don't feel comfortable with the cultural approach, or because it
      lacks relevance.</p>
    <p>Monolingual sites may be developed using a simple version of English (or whatever the base language is), and may be checked for
      potentially troublesome cultural references. On the one hand, this removes some of the risk of alienation and appeals as a relatively low cost
      approach to internationalization; but on the other, it may lead to a cultural blandness that reduces the impact on and the attractiveness to the
      reader. This approach will be particularly problematic if you are attempting to sell to, persuade, or entertain the reader, or even educate in an
      engaging way.</p>

  <section id="mcc">
    <h3>Monolingual, changed content</h3>
    <p>Some international sites, while remaining monolingual, may attempt to vary content for the local reader to increase impact and
      relevance. For example, it may be important to tailor information to suit the different buying habits, prices, legal requirements, or other varying
      social conditions of the international audience.</p>
    <p>This is somewhat more costly and complex to manage, but may pay dividends in terms of user responsiveness. It still scores low,
      however, in terms of general accessibility.</p>
  </section>
  
<section id="mlsc">
    <h3>Multilingual, same content</h3>
    <p>Sites that provide multilingual content address understandability, but not necessarily cultural differences or relevance.</p>
    <p>Some multilingual sites are purely a translation of the original web site. This helps users understand material better, but may still
      lack sufficient impact and relevance for the local reader.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="mlcc">
    <h3>Multilingual, changed content</h3>
    <p>Translation alone may be appropriate for technically oriented sites such as the W3C site, but if your site, or a part of your site, is
      attempting to persuade the reader to do or buy something the ideal is to have multilingual sites that are also adapted to the reader's local culture
      and interests. Content adaptation also increases relevance.</p>
    <p>This latter approach, however, brings into sharp focus the balance between desired impact on the reader and the costs and complexity
      of implementation.</p>

<h2>By the way</h2>
  <p>The W3C accepts translations of its specifications and web pages provided by volunteers. Information is currently available in many
    languages and writing systems.  For more information see the <a class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/">Translation page</a>.</p>
