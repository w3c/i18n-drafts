  <p>A <dfn id="def_floating_time">floating time</dfn> or a <dfn id="dfn_floating_date">floating date</dfn> is a time value that isn't tied to a specific time zone. 
     Applications that work with floating times need to avoid pitfalls that can arise from implicit conversion to <em>incremental time</em> values or the improper
     use of time zones when displaying or processing a floating time value.
  </p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2 id="detail"><a href="#detail">Details</a></h2>
  <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/timezone/">Working with Timezones</a> WG Note says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some observed time values are not related to a specific moment in incremental time. Instead, they need to be combined with local information to determine a range of acceptable incremental time values. We refer to these sorts of time values as "floating times" because they are not fixed to a specific incremental time value. Floating times are not attached and should never be attached to a particular time zone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, a floating time usually refers to a range of possible time values that share a specific relationship
   to the defined moment in time that the floating value represents. Examples of floating times include concepts such as
   birth date, starting or ending dates for a worldwide event, holidays, or publication dates.</p>
   
<p>For example, consider the publication date of a document&mdash;let's say a specific issue of an online newspaper. 
   On <em>30 April 2017</em> this newspaper published a Sunday edition. And indeed, the newspaper 
   might have declared the date like this in HTML: </p>
<figure class="example">
<p> &lt;p&gt;Publication Date: &lt;time datetime=&quot;2017-04-30&quot;&gt;April 30, 2017&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
</figure>
  <p>This seems unambiguous. Yet for some reason when Martina, who is in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
   opens the Web site, she sees "Saturday edition" and "29 April 2017" as the date for her copy. Problems such as this
   can arise if Web developers or content authors do not treat the publication date as a floating time value. For example, 
   the JavaScript <code class="kw" translate="no">Date</code> object is a form of <em>incremental</em> time: it represents 
   the number of milliseconds since an <span class="qterm">epoch date</span>. 
  In the case of JavaScript, the epoch data is the same as that used by Unix, the Java programming language, and many other systems: 
  it's defined as midnight, January 1, 1970 in the UTC (Universal Coordinated Time) time zone. So for Martina's
  newspaper, the value in the HTML document might be converted in JavaScript to a <code class="kw" translate="no">Date</code> object
  with the value: <kbd>1493510400000</kbd> (in milliseconds since the epoch).</p>
  
    <figure class="example">
    <pre>var date = new Date(myPubDateElement.value);
var target = document.getElementById(&quot;date_target&quot;);
target.appendChild(document.createTextNode(date.toDateString()));</pre>
  </figure>
  <p>Suppose your element <code class="kw" translate="no">myPubDateElement</code> contained the value above (2017-04-30). 
  You'd expect the element <code class="kw" translate="no">date_target</code> contain a string representing that date. 
  However, if you live in a time zone west of UTC (such as Martina, in the <code class="kw" translate="no">America/Buenos_Aires</code> time zone), 
  you'll get a surprise. It says: </p>
  <figure class="example">
    <pre>Sat Apr 29 21:00:00 ART 2017</pre>
  </figure>
  <p>The problem here is that many of the <code class="kw" translate="no">Date</code> methods in JavaScript are sensitive to the local system's time zone and they try to present the value using local time zone rules. Because the time of day was not 
  specified, the time is treated as <q>midnight</q>, so anyone displaying the underlying value in a time zone following UTC will naturally see the previous day. 
  In the case of a system running in the <code class="kw" translate="no">America/Buenos_Aires</code> time zone, which has an offset from UTC of either -3 hours or -2 hours (depending on whether or not daylight savings time is in effect) the value presented to the user from the JavaScript is incorrect because the the <code class="kw" translate="no">time</code> portion 
  of the publication date is zeroed out. Subtracting two or three hours from the <code class="kw" translate="no">Date</code> object results in a presentation string that is on the <span class="qterm">previous</span> day. That day might be in the wrong month or even the wrong year.</p>
  
  <p>Because the local interpretation of a given date depends on the local time&mdash;that is, it depends 
  on the local calendar, clock, and time zone rules&mdash;the range of incremental times that might be described as <samp>2017-04-30</samp> turns out to span as 
  many as fifty hours. The earliest time that can be called "30 April 2017" starts in Kiribati in the South Pacific, some 14 hours before midnight
  on 30 April 2017 occurs in UTC. The last moment that can be called part of "30 April 2017" occurs just before midnight of "1 May 2017" on the
  island of Midway's time zone, some 11 hours after "30 April 2017" has ended in UTC (there is an even later zone, but it is uninhabited). 
  Depending on the time zone used to create and then later to display an incremental time value, the same floating date value could 
  appear to be as much as two days off.</p>
  
  <p>That's because, while a floating time is not tied to a specific time zone, any incremental time values depend 
  on time zone for their display and processing. Since data formats for time values in both server-side (such as Java or PHP) 
  and client-side languages (such as JavaScript) are always incremental times, this can lead to problems such as Martina's mysterious
  newspaper publication date. </p>
  
  <p>One way to work around this it to always use the UTC time zone for processing floating time values. Developers have to
  be careful to convert time values into incremental time objects using an offset of zero and segregate code that deals with
  floating times from more-normal time values such as time stamps.</p>
  
  <h3 id="yyyshortcomings2"><a href="#yyyshortcomings">Storing, Retrieving, and Aggregating Time Data</a></h3>
  <p>Another way that floating times are used is in the aggregation of data. For example, suppose you are
  building an application that keeps track of the number of downloads a user makes. You can record each
  download using a timestamp (an incremental time value). That might look like this: </p>
  <figure class="example">
    <pre>{
    &quot;user-id&quot;: &quot;9333c644-487a-11e7-a919-92ebcb67fe33&quot;,
    &quot;item&quot;: &quot;http://www.example.com/downloadMe&quot;,
    &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2013-10-02T07:17:00Z&quot;,
    &quot;user-timezone&quot;: &quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;
},</pre>
  </figure>
  <p>When your application wants to aggregate statistics, the use of incremental times
    to represent the aggregated data could become a problem. Suppose you want to 
    accumulate user statistics, such as total downloads, on a daily basis. 
    The timestamp in the example above might fall on October 2, 2013 for that customer. 
    In this case, if the time zone were <code class=kw translate=no>America/Los_Angeles</code> as
    shown in the record, it would not! Here's what the accumulated record might look like:</p>
  <figure class="example">
    <pre>{
    &quot;user-id&quot;: &quot;9333c644-487a-11e7-a919-92ebcb67fe33&quot;,
    &quot;aggregationDate&quot;: &quot;2013-10-01&quot;,
    &quot;numDownloaded&quot;: 10
},</pre>
  </figure>
  <p>In this case, you want to use local time rules, including the time zone,
  in order to compute which floating date the download should accumulate to. But you want to use floating time
  rules to read and write the accumulated data record. That way the statistics remain the same
  for a given date, even if the user's time zone has changed in the interim. For example,
  if the customer moves to the <code class=kw translate=no>Europe/Paris</code> time zone, the
  number of downloads on <code>2013-10-01</code> should remain the same, even though the
  accumulation rules might be different now than they were previously.</p>
