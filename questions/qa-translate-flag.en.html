  </section>
  
 

<section id="nutshell">
    <h2 id="quickanswer"><a href="#quickanswer">Quick answer</a></h2>
  <p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> attribute <a class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-translate-attribute">in HTML5</a> indicates that the content of the element should or should not be translated. There is no effect on the rendered page (although you could, of course, style it if you found a good reason for doing so). For example,</p>
  <figure class="example">
    <p><code><span translate="no">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Using HTML's <span translate="no">&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;</span> attribute<span translate="no">&lt;/h1&gt;</span></code></p>
  </figure>
  <p>The attribute can appear on any element, and it takes just two values: <code class="kw" translate="no">yes</code> or <code class="kw" translate="no">no</code>. If the value is <code class="kw" translate="no">no</code>, translation tools should protect the text of the element from translation. The translation tool in question could be an automated translation engine, like those used in the online services offered by Google, Microsoft and Yandex. Or it could be a human translator's 'workbench' tool, which would prevent the translator inadvertently changing the text.</p>
  <p>Setting this translate flag on an element applies the value to all contained element content. HTML5 has a list of  attributes that are to be translated by default, but these attributes should not be translated if they are on an element where <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> is set to <code class="kw" translate="no">no</code>. Otherwise attributes should not be translated.</p>
  <p>If a page has no <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> attribute, a translation system or translator should assume that all the text is to be translated.  The <code class="kw" translate="no">yes</code> value is therefore likely to see little use, though it could be very useful if you need to override a translate flag on a parent element and indicate some bits of text that should be translated. You may want to translate the natural language text in examples of source code, for example, but leave the code untranslated.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="why"><a href="#why">Why it is needed?</a></h3>
    <p>Adding the <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> attribute to your page can help readers better understand your content when they run it through automatic translation systems, and can save a significant amount of cost and hassle for translation vendors with large throughput in many languages.</p>
    <p>You come across a need for this quite frequently. There is an example in the HTML5 spec about the Bee Game.  Here is a similar, but real example  where the documentation being translated referred to a machine with  text in English  on the hardware panel that wasn't translated.</p>
    <figure class="example" translate="no" its-loc-note="Do NOT translate this example." its-loc-note-type="alert">
      <p><code>&lt;p&gt;Click the Resume button on the Status Display or the<br>
        &lt;span class="panelmsg" translate="no"&gt;CONTINUE&lt;/span&gt; button<br>
        on the printer panel.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>
    <p>In a <span its-loc-note="Feel free to change the word 'German' to the language you are translating into, if you translate the following example." its-loc-note-type="alert">German</span> translation this will become:</p>
    <figure class="example" translate="no" its-loc-note="Human translators can translate this example, despite the translate flag on this figure (apart, of course , from the word CONTINUE). The translate=no markup on figure is to protect the text from machine translation." its-loc-note-type="alert">
      <p><code>&lt;p&gt;Drücken Sie Fortsetzen in der Statusanzeige oder die<br>
        Taste &lt;span class="panelmsg" translate="no"&gt;CONTINUE&lt;/span&gt;<br>
        an Ihrem Drucker.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>
    <p>Here are a couple more real-life examples of content that could benefit from the <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> attribute.  The first is from a book, quoting a title of a work which should stay in the original language.</p>
    <figure class="example" its-loc-note="Translate this example." its-loc-note-type="alert">
      <p><code>&lt;p&gt;The question in the title &lt;cite translate="no"&gt;How Far Can You Go?&lt;/cite&gt; applies to both the undermining of traditional religious belief by radical theology and the undermining of literary convention by the device of "breaking frame"...&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>
    <p>The next example is taken directly from a page in English about French bread – the French for bread is <i class="foreignphrase" lang="fr" translate="no">pain</i> – and the code contains no <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> attribute. The original is in English, which means that an automatic translation will translate the English word <span class="qterm" translate="no" lang="en">pain</span> as a highly unpleasant physical sensation, rather than a thing you eat.</p>
    <figure class="example" translate="no" its-loc-note="Do NOT translate this example." its-loc-note-type="alert">
      <p><code>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;strong&gt;french pain&lt;/strong&gt; on Facebook. Join now to write reviews and connect with &lt;strong&gt;french pain&lt;/strong&gt;. Help your friends discover great places to visit by recommending &lt;strong&gt;french pain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>
    <p>It would be best to add <code translate="no">translate=&quot;no&quot;</code> to the <code class="kw" translate="no">strong</code> elements. (And, by the way, it would also be useful for things like voice browsers to also surround the word <i class="foreignphrase" lang="fr" translate="no">pain</i>&nbsp;with <code translate="no">&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;</code>.)</p>
    <p>You may also want to use it to protect keywords, code samples or examples from being translated. In the first paragraph of the example below, markup  that looks like ordinary English words is being protected from translation. The source code of the second paragraph ensures that the whole paragraph remains in English.</p>
    <figure class="example" translate="no" its-loc-note="Do NOT translate this example." its-loc-note-type="alert">
      <p><code>&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;label&lt;span&gt; element using the &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; attribute:&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
      <p><code>&lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label for=&quot;postcode&quot;&amp;gt;Enter your postcode to find the nearest store:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt; &amp;lt;input id=&quot;postcode&quot; type=&quot;text&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>

  <section>
    <h3 id="whentouse"><a href="#whentouse">When to use translate=&quot;yes&quot;</a></h3>
    <p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">yes</code> value of the <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> attribute is mostly used to override the effect of setting <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> to <code class="kw" translate="no">no</code>. For example, we may want to allow the natural language text of the above source code to be translated, while protecting the code itself (ie. the keywords such as <code class="kw" translate="no">label</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">for</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">postcode</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">input</code>, etc.). We could do that by surrounding the natural language text with elements that have the <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> attribute.</p>
    <figure class="example" translate="no">
      <p><code>&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;label&lt;span&gt; element using the &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; attribute:&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
      <p><code>&lt;code translate=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label for=&quot;postcode&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;span translate=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;Enter your postcode to find the nearest store&lt;/span&gt;:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt; &amp;lt;input id=&quot;postcode&quot; type=&quot;text&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>

  <section>
    <h3 id="attributes"><a href="#attributes">Working with attributes</a></h3>
    <div class="sidenoteGroup">
      <p>It can be problematic to deal with attribute values in translation. Generally speaking, attribute values are part of the syntax of the page, and should therefore not be translated. If they are, the page will break. In some cases, however, the values contain human readable text (eg. <code class="kw" translate="no">title</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">alt</code>, and <code class="kw" translate="no">placeholder</code> attribute values in HTML), although this is not recommended.*</p>
      <div class="sideinfonote">
        <p class="footnote">For example, it is impossible to use markup for attribute values to manage bidirectional text in languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, or to mark up such things as language changes. And of course, it can be difficult to determine which attribute values should be translated and which should not. It is also difficult to identify a part of an attribute value that should be left untranslated, or an attribute value that should be left untranslated although the element content is translated. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The HTML specification <a class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-translate-attribute">lists  attributes</a> that should be treated as translatable. Attribute values not in this list are not to be translated.</p>
    <p>If a 'translatable' attribute value appears on an element which has <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> set to <code class="kw" translate="no">no</code>, then the expectation is that the attribute value will also remain untranslated. </p>
    <p>This can, of course, cause problems in cases where you <em>do</em> want the attribute values to be translated but not the element content, or vice versa. In some cases those situations can be mitigated by nesting the markup concerned.  For example, you could have an outer <code class="kw" translate="no">span</code> element with <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> set to <code class="kw" translate="no">yes</code> that  carries the <code class="kw" translate="no">title</code> attribute you want to be translated. Inside that <code class="kw" translate="no">span</code> you could put another <code class="kw" translate="no">span</code> with <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> set to <code class="kw" translate="no">no</code> and containing the element content. This is how articles such as the one you are reading handle links to translated versions of a page – the <code class="kw" translate="no">title</code> attribute of the outer element carries the name of the language pointed to, and the inner element carries the name of that language in the language itself (which should not be changed). This also helps when labelling the language using the <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> attribute.</p>
    <p>The following example shows how you could protect the word 'English', when it is a link to the English version of the document, when translating a page which is in German to another language. The informative <code class="kw" translate="no">title</code> attribute would be translated. Without the translate flag,  online services currently tend to translate the word 'English' to the equivalent in the target language or to 'Deutsch'.</p>
    <figure class="example" translate="no">
      <p><code>&lt;span title=&quot;Englisch&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;article.en.html&quot; translate=&quot;no&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
    </figure>
    <p>Because these are attribute values, however,  it is still impossible to indicate  whether <em>parts</em> of the text in the attribute value should be protected from translation. </p>
    <p>(Bear in mind that the HTML5 specification, at the time of writing, is not yet stable, and implementations may not yet follow the specification.) </p>
    <p>This approach is  different from the general approach recommended by the ITS specification for XML-based languages. ITS (see below) recommends that attribute values be left untranslated by default, but it also provides a way of indicating specific attributes that should be translated, independent of their context. </p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="how"><a href="#how">Adding translate flags  to a page</a></h3>
    <p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> attribute can, of course, be added to a page by a content author who is mindful of how they want the page to appear after translation. This is particularly useful for protecting content when a reader runs a page through an automatic translation service, such as those offered by Google, Microsoft and Yandex.</p>
    <p>In industrial translation scenarios, localizers may add attributes during the translation preparation stage, as a way of avoiding the multiplicative effects of dealing with mistranslations in a large number of languages. This may be done via automated processes, such as entity recognition tools, that automatically recognize proper nouns.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to use external files to (among other things) point to markup that should not be translated. For example, you may want to indicate that all <code class="kw" translate="no">span</code> elements with a given class name should not be translated. A way of doing this is described by the <a class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/#EX-translate-selector-1"><cite>Internationalization Tag Set (ITS)</cite></a> specification. A set of such rules can be valid for one page or many pages at the same time. Content developers and localizers may work closely together in setting up these rules to achieve a faster and better localization process.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="how2"><a href="#how">Implementation support for the translate flag</a></h3>
    <p>The code <code translate="no">translate=&quot;no&quot;</code> is supported by Google, Microsoft and Yandex online translation services   at the time of writing. The use of <code translate="no">translate=&quot;yes&quot; </code>to allow translation within a part of the document where translation is disallowed is not supported by Microsoft, but is supported by the other two services.</p>
    <p><a class="print" href="/International/tests/repository/html5/translation-services/results-translation-services">See the latest test results</a>.</p>
    <p>The MultilingualWeb-LT Working Group, which has been working on the <cite>Internationalization Tag Set</cite> specification, has compiled a document, <a class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mlw-metadata-us-impl/"><cite>Metadata for the Multilingual Web – Usage Scenarios and Implementations</cite></a>, that describes other applications and usage scenarios where the translate flag is recognized.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="stickyness"><a href="#stickyness">Legacy approaches for online translation services</a></h3>
    <p>Before the <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> attribute was defined, both Google and Microsoft online translation services supported a number of other, non-standard ways to express similar ideas.</p>
    <p>Both Google and Microsoft  support <code translate="no">class="notranslate"</code>, but replacing a <code class="kw" translate="no">class</code> attribute value with an attribute that is a formal part of the language makes this feature much more reliable, especially in wider contexts. For example, a translation prep tool would be able to rely on the meaning of the HTML5 <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> attribute always being what is expected. Also it becomes easier to port the concept to other scenarios, such as other translation APIs or localization standards such as <a class="print" href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xliff">XLIFF</a>.</p>
    <p>Microsoft apparently supports <code translate="no">style="notranslate"</code>.  This is not one of the options Google lists for their online service, but on the other hand they have things that are not available via Microsoft's service.</p>
    <p>For example, if you have an entire page that should not be translated, you can add <code translate="no">&lt;meta name="google" value="notranslate"&gt;</code> inside the <code class="kw" translate="no">head</code> element of your page and Google won't translate any of the content on that page. (However they also support <code translate="no">&lt;meta name="google" content="notranslate"&gt;</code>.)  This shouldn't be Google specific, and a single way of doing this, ie. <code translate="no">translate="no"</code> on the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag, is far cleaner.</p>
    <p>Microsoft and Google's translation engines also don't translate content within <code class="kw" translate="no">code</code> elements. Note, however, that you don't seem to have any choice about this – there don't seem to be instructions about how to override this if you do want your <code class="kw" translate="no">code</code> element content translated.</p>
    <p>As already mentioned, the new HTML5 <code class="kw" translate="no">translate</code> attribute provides a simple and standard feature of HTML that can replace and simplify all these different approaches, and will help authors develop content that will work with other systems too. </p>
