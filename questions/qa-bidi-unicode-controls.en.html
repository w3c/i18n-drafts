<p>This article looks at how content authors can apply direction metadata to bidirectional text when markup is not available.</p>

<p class="warning"><strong>The article assumes that you are familiar with bidirectional text concepts and managing bidirectional text using HTML markup, but that you need to know how to do similar things with Unicode control characters, such as when writing plain text.</strong> If you are not familiar with how bidirectional text works in Unicode, you should  read through the article <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics"><cite>Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</cite></a> before continuing.</p>

<p class="warning">If you are not familiar with how to manage bidirectional text in HTML markup, you may also find it useful to first read <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/"><cite>Inline markup and bidirectional text in HTML</cite></a>.</p>





<section id="reasons">
<h2>What this article does and doesn't cover</h2>
    <p>You will still need to use markup to establish the default direction for a document as a whole (eg. in the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag), and to change direction for block container elements. Because control codes don't cross paragraph (read as <span class="qterm">block element</span>) boundaries, and because control codes cannot manage inheritance and scoping through the markup hierarchy, they are only appropriate for inline use.</p>
<p>For example, although a <code class="kw" translate="no">title</code> element in the header of an HTML page cannot contain markup, it is still possible to set a default base direction on the <code class="kw" translate="no">title</code> element tag  (or for it to inherit the direction set on the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag). This article is about how to apply directional changes in inline or other plain text situations, such as <em>within</em> the <code class="kw" translate="no">title</code> element or a <code class="kw" translate="no">title</code> attribute, or how to apply a direction to attribute text which is different from that of the surrounding element, and so on. It also applies to plain text formats such as WebVTT and CSV.</p>

<h2>Changing the direction of an inline range of text</h2>
  <p>If you want to change the  direction for a run of inline text you need to indicate a start and end point. For this you need to use one of the following  characters to indicate the start of the embedded direction change.</p>

    <p>These characters are invisible, although in some editors it may be possible to show symbols that represent them. You could also use character escapes to represent them, such as <code>&amp;#x2067;</code>, but in bidirectional source text you may find that the characters in the escape don't stay together. (See <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-source.en.html"><cite>Working with source code markup and code examples for RTL scripts</cite></a> for more on this.)</p>

<p>When you apply directional formatting characters to indicate the boundaries of a directional run, you really want to avoid what's inside the boundaries interacting with what's outside – ie. you want to <em>isolate</em> it. For this reason, in an ideal world you would want to follow the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/tr9-46.html#Directional_Formatting_Characters">recommendation</a> of the Unicode Standard to  use RLI and LRI,  and avoid using RLE and LRE.</p>
<p>The following example shows how these control characters could be used in
      plain text. It shows a tooltip in HTML that includes the title of the document linked to (which includes the abbreviation 'FAQ'), plus some text indicating the language of the destination document. Note how the text '(FAQ)' appears to the right of the Persian text. This is incorrect, since it is part of the (right-to-left) document title.</p>
    <figure class="example">
<p><img src="qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/persian-link-wrong.png" alt="A tooltip without control characters." title="'SNOITSEUQ DEKSA YLTNEUQERF (faq)' [in persian]" /></p>
    </figure>
    <p> The correct title has the text '(FAQ)' to the left of the Persian text, as shown here.</p>


<figure class="example">
<p><img src="qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/persian-link-right.png" alt="A tooltip with control characters." title="'(faq) SNOITSEUQ DEKSA YLTNEUQERF' [in persian]" /></p>
</figure>


<p>To achieve the correct effect we add the two invisible control characters,  <span class="uname" style="color: green;">U+2067 RIGHT-TO-LEFT ISOLATE</span> (RLI), and <span class="uname" style="color: red;">U+2069 POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE</span> (PDI), represented in the code snippet below as numeric character entities. Characters are shown in 'logical' order, rather than in the order they will be rendered.</p>

<figure class="example">
<blockquote><code>
<bdo dir="ltr">title=&quot;'<span style="color: green;" title="RLE">&amp;#x2067;</span>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (faq)<span style="color: red;" title="PDF">&amp;#x2069;</span>' [in persian]&quot;</bdo>

<section id="wrapping">
<h2>Tightly wrapping opposite-direction phrases</h2>
 
<p>In some cases the bidi algorithm copes fine with bidirectional text, and in others it needs some help. In <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/#tightwrap"><cite>Inline markup and bidirectional text in HTML</cite></a> we make the case that the easiest approach to marking up bidirectional text is to put markup at the start and end of each directional change in the text. This doesn't do any harm, it avoids the likelihood of missing a situation where markup is needed, and it makes the life of the content author much simpler. You should wrap the relevant text <a class="termref" href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/#tightwrap">tightly</a>.</p>
 
<p>Similarly, when dealing with Unicode control characters it makes sense to put directional formatting characters at the start and end of each directional change in the text.</p>
 
<p>However, it's important to bear in mind  that ranges need to be nested appropriately. If you have an embedded LTR range in a RTL context, and that LTR range has some RTL text inside it, it won't produce the right result if your ranges are side by side rather than nested. Note how the direction changes are embedded in the following example, rather than side by side.</p>

<figure class="example">
<p><code>the title is <span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2067;</span>AN INTRODUCTION TO <span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2066;</span>c++<span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2069;</span><span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2069;</span> in arabic.</code></p>

<section id="spillovers">
<h2>Dealing with spillover issues</h2>
    <p>A classic example of a spillover effect is the following, where the <a class="termref" href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/#oppositedirection">opposite-direction phrase</a> is followed by a logically separate number. This is the code with RLE...PDF around the opposite-direction text:</p>


<figure class="example">
<div class="badcode"><span><img src="../icons/dontcopy.png" alt=" "> Bad code. Don't copy!</span> <a href="qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/eg-number-wrong" onclick="showExample('qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/eg-number-wrong'); return false;"><img class="codelink" src="../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example."></a></div>
<p><code>we find the phrase '<span style="color:red;">&amp;#x202B;</span>INTERNATIONALIZATION ACTIVITY<span style="color:red;">&amp;#x202C;</span>' 5 times on the page.</code></p>
</figure>

<div id="out_number_placement_wrong" class="browser_output">
<p class="browser_output_title">Output in your browser:</p>
<div class="browser_output_example">
<p>We found the phrase "&#x202B;‫פעילות הבינאום‬&#x202C;" 5 times on the page.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>You would expect to see:</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/number-following-right.png" alt="Displayed result of previous code"></p>
    </figure>
    <p style="clear: both;">You would actually see:</p>
    <figure>
      <p><img src="qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/number-following-wrong.png" alt="Displayed result of previous code"></p>
    </figure>
    <p style="clear: both;">This happens because the bidi algorithm tells the browser to treat the "5″ as part of the Hebrew text, ignoring that the preceding text is in a different embedding level. This is not appropriate. We need to find a way to say that the name and the number are separate things, ie. to isolate the inserted name from the number.</p>
<p style="clear: both;">The RLI/LRI control codes  solve this problem by isolating the embedded text from the number that follows it. You would simply use RLI...PDI instead of RLE...PDF.</p>
 

<figure class="example">
<p><code>we find the phrase '<span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2067;</span>INTERNATIONALIZATION ACTIVITY<span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2069;</span>' 5 times on the page.</code></p>

</div>
</div>
</section>





<section id="rlmlrm">
<h2>RLM and LRM</h2>

<p>Unicode provides two other invisible format characters related to direction.</p>


<table class="inband">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Character</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Code point</th>
<th>Equivalent markup</th>
<th>Comment</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LRM</td>
<td>LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK</td>
<td>U+200E</td>
<td>none</td>
<td>strongly typed LTR character</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RLM</td>
<td>RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</td>
<td>U+200F</td>
<td>none</td>
<td>strongly typed RTL character</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>They are less problematic because they are used singly, ie. they are not used in pairs to delimit ranges of text like the other control characters we have discussed. However, they don't have the same power as the paired formatting codes. Because they are strongly-typed characters, they extend or break the ranges established by default by the bidi algorithm.</p>

<p>In the example above, we need to tell the bidi algorithm that the 5 is part of the LTR text. To do that, we can insert an LRM character before it.</p>

<div class="sidenoteGroup">
    <figure class="example">
      <div class="badcode"><a href="qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/eg-number-ok" onclick="showExample('qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/eg-number-ok'); return false;"><img class="codelink" src="../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example."></a></div>
      <p><code>we find the phrase 'INTERNATIONALIZATION ACTIVITY'<span style="color:red;">&amp;lrm;</span> 5 times on the page.</code></p>
    </figure>
    <aside class="sideinfonote"><p class="info">We use an HTML named entity escape here, since these are defined for RLM and LRM. They are not defined for the previously mentioned control characters (RLI, RLE, etc.).</p></aside>
</div>

<div id="out_number_placement" class="browser_output">
<p class="browser_output_title">Output in your browser:</p>
<div class="browser_output_example">
<p>We found the phrase "نشاط التدويل"&lrm; 5 times on the page.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>This will now produce the display we expect. Because the LRM code point is strongly LTR in direction, it breaks the link between the number and the preceding RTL text.</p>
<p>However, one thing these single characters cannot do is establish a base direction for an embedded range of inline text so that punctuation and nested direction changes are handled properly. For those use cases you need to use the paired characters.</p>
</section>







<section id="exceptions">
<h2>Related issues</h2>
<p>In this section we illustrate some additional spillover problems that can be solved using directional formatting characters.</p>




<section id="lists">
<h3><a href="#lists">Lists</a></h3>

<p>In our first example, we have a list of same-direction runs of text (in this case RTL), which need to be ordered according to the overall context (in this case LTR).</p>

<p><a class="termref" href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics.en.html#neutralcharacters">Neutral characters</a> between same directional runs can  sometimes be misinterpreted by the bidi algorithm. In this use case we have several country names in Arabic listed in a LTR paragraph. This is an example of an opposite-direction phrase followed by another, but logically separate, opposite-direction phrase.</p>

<p>We expect to see the following:</p>


<figure>
<p><img src="qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/comma-right.gif" alt="Egypt appears to the left of Bahrain." /></p>
</figure>
<p>If no formatting codes are used the actual result is that the first two Arabic words are reversed and the intervening comma is moved to the right side of the space between the words.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/comma-wrong.gif" alt="Bahrain appears to the left of Egypt." /></p>
</figure>

<p>The reason for the failure is that, with a strongly typed right-to-left (RTL) character on either side, the bidirectional algorithm sees the neutral comma and space as part of the Arabic text. It is interpreting the first two Arabic words and the comma and space  as a single directional run in Arabic. In fact the comma  and space are part of the English text, and should mark the boundary between the two separate right-to-left directional runs in
      Arabic. </p>
    <p>The solution for this use case is to break the first two items of the list apart by either surrounding each list item with paired RLI/PDI codes, or by inserting the strong LTR-typed LRM character.</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <div class="badcode"><a href='qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/eg-lists-ok' onclick="showExample('qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/eg-lists-ok'); return false;"><img class="codelink" src="../icons/codelink.gif" alt="View code." title="View code for this example." /></a></div>
      <p><code>the names of these states in arabic are <span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2067;</span>EGYPT<span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2069;</span>, <span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2067;</span>BAHRAIN<span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2069;</span> and <span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2067;</span>KUWAIT<span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2069;</span> respectively.</code></p>
<p><code>the names of these states in arabic are EGYPT<span style="color:red;">&amp;lrm;</span>, BAHRAIN </span>and </span>KUWAIT respectively.</code></p>

<p>The names of these states in Arabic are ‫مصر‬&lrm;, ‫البحرين‬ and ‫الكويت‬ respectively.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
  
  
  <section id="punctuation">
<h3>Punctuation</h3>
    <p> It is very common  for punctuation or some other neutral character to appear at the end of an opposite direction phrase and belong with that phrase.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, such neutrals between different directional runs are typically misinterpreted unless the Bidi Algorithm is given additional help. In the following example, the exclamation mark  is part of the Arabic text and so should appear to
      its left, like this:</p>
    <figure>
      <p><img src="qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/exclamation-right.gif" alt="An exclamation mark appearing to the left of Arabic text." /></p>
    </figure>
    <p>Unfortunately, if we rely solely on the bidirectional algorithm we see this:</p>
    <figure>
      <p><img src="qa-bidi-unicode-controls-data/exclamation-wrong.gif" alt="An exclamation mark appearing to the right of Arabic text." /></p>
    </figure>
    <p>Given an understanding of the bidi algorithm we can easily understand why this happened. Because the exclamation mark was typed in
      between the last RTL letter 'ب' (on the left)‌ and the LTR letter 'i' (of the word 'in') its directionality is determined by the base direction of
      the paragraph, ie. LTR in this case. Because the exclamation mark is seen as LTR it joins the directional run that includes the text
      'in Arabic'.</p>
    <p>We can fix this easily in one of two ways. We can simply <span style="clear: both;">add an RLM/LRM character after the exclamation mark. You need to choose the character that has the same directionality as the preceding phrase, thereby extending the length of the directional run to include the punctuation.</span></p>
    <figure class="example">
      <p><code>the title is &quot;INTERNATIONALIZATION ACTIVITY!<span style="color:red;">&amp;rlm;</span>&quot; in arabic.</code></p>
    </figure>

<p class="browser_output_title">Output in your browser:</p>
<div class="browser_output_example">
<p>The title is "نشاط التدويل!&rlm;" in arabic.</p>
</div>
</div>

    <p style="clear: both;">Alternatively, you could wrap the opposite-direction phrase in paired controls, in this case RLI followed by PDI.</p>
    <figure class="example">
      <p><code>the title is &quot;<span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2067;</span>INTERNATIONALIZATION ACTIVITY!<span style="color:red;">&amp;#x2069;</span>&quot; in arabic.</code></p>

<h2 id="injection"><a href="#injection">Managing injected text</a></h2>
<p>It's possible that you want to inject text into content at run time. If that text comes with control codes around it, you are likely to be ok. If not, you may have a problem.</p>
<p>Take for example a scenario where a user has requested a book with a Hebrew title in a search on an English page. That book was not found, and the English page wants to provide the user with a friendly message to that effect. Without any directional information, you would likely see something like this.</p>

<p>This is problematic because the 'CSS' should appear at the end of the Hebrew title, ie. to the left.  </p>
<p>Possibiliities include (a) the book title has control codes at the start and end to indicate the base direction, (b) the script has access to some out-of-band information about the base direction of the book title, (c) there is no information about the base direction of the book title, and a guess has to be made.</p>
<p>If you were to add the book name to the error message using scripting, you'd need to identify the place where it should go. In HTML this would usually be done using markup.  You'd then need to establish the base direction for the injected text. It doesn't seem to make much sense to use control codes in such a situation, since you could simply add <code>dir="auto"</code> to the markup and solve your problem. Besides which, FSI is the only code point you could use, and that is not yet supported by browsers.</p>
