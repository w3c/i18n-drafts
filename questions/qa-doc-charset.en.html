  <div class="insideinfonote"><p class="info">For simplicity, and in line with common practice, when we refer to Unicode in this FAQ we are referring to the character set defined by both Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646.</p></div>
  <p>The <strong>document character set</strong> or <strong>base character set</strong> of XML and HTML (from version 4.0) is the Universal
    Character Set (UCS) defined by both ISO/IEC 10646 and <a class="print" href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a> standards, which are code for code identical.</p>
  <p>This means that the logical model describing how XML and HTML are processed is described in terms of the Unicode character set.</p>
  <p>It does not mean that all HTML and XML documents have to be <em>encoded</em> as Unicode, but it does mean that these documents can only
    contain characters defined by Unicode. Note that <strong>character sets and character encodings are different things</strong> - for example, the full Unicode
    repertoire can be encoded in more than one way, eg. UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. Any character encoding can be used for your document as long as it is properly
    declared and the characters it represents are a subset of the Unicode repertoire. (It would be extremely unusual to find one that wasn't a subset.)</p>
  <p>On the other hand, it is a good idea to use a Unicode encoding wherever possible, since it <a class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/#Slide0110">simplifies many aspects</a> of Web
    internationalization and is supported widely by HTML user agents, and by all XML processors.</p>
  <p>An important consequence of the document character set is that values of numeric character references (such as &amp;#x01F5; or
    &amp;#501; for <span class="uname" translate="no">LATIN SMALL LETTER G WITH ACUTE</span>) are interpreted as Unicode characters – no matter what encoding you use for your document. This is a
    common source of error among those who are not clear about the distinction.</p>

  <h2 id="bytheway"><a href="#bytheway">By the way</a></h2>
  <p>In practice, not all Unicode characters can be used everywhere in XML and HTML. For example, certain characters are excluded from things
    like element tag names, and certain control characters are excluded from content. Note, however, that XML 1.1 allows the use of many more characters
    for such things as element tag names than XML 1.0.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2 id="history"><a href="#history">Historical information</a></h2>
  <p>HTML 2.0 defined that all characters in an HTML document are to be interpreted relative to ISO 8859-1 (also known as ISO Latin 1), but
    also announced that all future versions of HTML will use a superset of that, viz. Unicode (or ISO 10646), which means that a vast number of the
    world's characters are available.</p>
  <p>The discussions about the right way to use Unicode on the Internet ( <a class="print" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2130.txt">RFC 2130</a>, April
    1997, and <a class="print" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2070.txt">RFC 2070</a>, Jan 1997) were not finished yet when <a class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32">HTML 3.2</a> came out (Jan 1997), so inclusion of Unicode into HTML had to wait for <a class="print" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40-971218/">HTML 4.0</a> (Dec 1997).</p>
