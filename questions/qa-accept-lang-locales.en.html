  <p>For a number of perfectly valid reasons some web applications would like to associate a locale with each user that visits the site. This
    locale would enable them to provide information in the local format. Some of this information is common to traditional software locales, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What numeric formats does the user expect?</li>
    <li>How should dates and times be formatted?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In other cases, other information may be derived from the locale information plus additional knowledge, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Should measurements be metric (centimeters, kilometers, liters) or imperial (inches, miles, gallons)?</li>
    <li>What is the user's time zone?</li>
    <li>Does the user use Letter size paper, or A4?</li>
    <li>What shoe and clothing sizing systems should be used?</li>
    <li>What is the user's physical location?</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Since none of these are included in the HTTP protocol many web developers have used the Accept-Language header to make inferences about
    the user's locale.</p>
  <p>The Accept-Language header is information about the user's language preferences that is passed via HTTP when a document is requested.
    Mainstream browsers allow these language preferences to be <a class="print" href="/International/questions/qa-lang-priorities">modified by the user</a>. The
    value itself is a defined by <a class="print" href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt">BCP&nbsp;47</a>, typically as a <a class="print" href="/International/articles/language-tags/">two or three letter language code</a> (eg. <code>fr</code> for French), followed by
    optional subcodes representing such things as country (eg. <code>fr-CA</code> represents French as spoken in Canada).</p>
  <p> The question is about whether this information is appropriate for determining the locale of the user.</p>

  <h2 id="answer"><a href="#answer">Answer</a></h2>
  <p>The HTTP Accept-Language header was originally only intended to specify the user's language. However, since many applications need to
    know the locale of the user, common practice has used Accept-Language to determine this information. It is not a good idea to use the HTTP
    Accept-Language header <strong>alone</strong> to determine the locale of the user. If you use Accept-Language exclusively, you may handcuff the user
    into a set of choices not to his liking.</p>
  <p>For a first contact, using the Accept-Language value to infer regional settings may be a good starting point, but be sure to allow them
    to change the language as needed and specify their cultural settings more exactly if necessary. Store the results in a database or a cookie for later
    visits. </p>
  <p>Some of the potential issues include the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Many users never change the defaults for Accept-Language. They are set when the user agent is installed. Unless they are multilingual
      or have some other reason to adjust language preferences they may not even know such settings exist. Hence, the user may not have ever ratified the
      Accept-Language setting.</li>
    <li>A user agent may send a request that specifies only a language and not a region, for example you may not get a header with <code><abbr title="German - Germany">de-DE</abbr></code>, <code><abbr title="German - Switzerland">de-CH</abbr></code> or <code><abbr
					title="German - Austria">de-AT</abbr></code> to indicate German as spoken in Germany, Switzerland or Austria, respectively. On the other hand, you
      might only get <code>de</code> indicating a preference for German. If you were planning to use the region to decide what currency to use you are now
      in a bind. Your particular circumstances might allow you to make assumptions such as "<em>Germany has 83 million people, Switzerland has 7 million
      but only 63% speak German, Austria has 8 million, so this user probably uses the Euro. If we're wrong we'll only offend 4.6% of our German speaking
      customers or just over 4 million people.</em>" Feel free to make such an assumption, if you can accept the risk. Its a lot simpler to ask the user
      for more information. Also, the math gets more difficult for Spanish or English, for instance.</li>
    <li>People borrow machines from friends, they rent them from internet cafes. In these cases the inferred locale may be inappropriate, and
      care should be taken to allow the user to select the appropriate language and locale from whatever page they are looking at.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Using the Accept-Language header is also a good starting point for determining the <strong>language</strong> of the user, rather than the
    locale, but even then you must know its limitations and give the user some way to override the assumptions you make. Many of the potential issues
    listed above apply here too.</p>
  <p>Even if you aren't intentionally making assumptions about locale or region, you should be aware that your programming environment may be
    making such assumptions on your behalf. Many Web servers, server side scripting languages, and operating environments, by default, parse and infer
    their native locale objects from Accept-Language. For example, .NET uses the Accept-Language to determine the default CultureInfo, Java Servlet
    provides a getLocale() and getLocales() pair of methods that parse Accept-Language, and so forth. These objects are very useful in obtaining
    resources and other "language preference" material. They are less useful, as pointed out above, in determining many of the fine grained attributes of
    users or in designing the international behavior of a site. A language preference of es-MX doesn't necessarily mean that a postal address form should
    be formatted or validated for Mexican addresses. The user might still live in the USA (or elsewhere).</p>
