    <p class="question">Which language tag is right for me? How do I choose language and other subtags?</p>

  <p>In HTML and XML documents a <dfn>language tag</dfn> is used to indicate the language of content.</p>
  <p>A language tag is composed of one or more <dfn>subtags</dfn> separated by hyphens. Subtags can be of various types.</p>
  <div class="insideinfonote">
    <p class="info">BCP stands for 'Best Current
      Practice', and is a persistent name for a series of <abbr title="Request For Comment">RFC</abbr>s whose numbers change as they are updated. The
      latest RFC describing language tag syntax is <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.txt">RFC 5646, Tags for the Identification of
      Languages</a>, and it obsoletes the older RFCs <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4646.txt">4646</a> <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt">3066</a> and <a href="http://www.nordu.net/ftp/rfc/rfc1766.txt">1766</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Language tag syntax is defined by the <abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr>'s <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt">BCP 47</a>.  In the past it was necessary to consult lists of codes in various ISO standards to find the right subtags, but
    now you only need to look in the <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry"><abbr
					title="Internet Assigned Numbers Authority">IANA</abbr> Language Subtag Registry</a>. We will describe the new registry below.</p>
  <p>This article provides advice on how to choose the components of a language tag. For an overview of the concepts defined in BCP 47, see <a href="/International/articles/language-tags/">Language tags in HTML and XML</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="answer"><a href="#answer">Answer</a></h2>
  <section>
      <aside class="insideinfonote">
        <p class="info">The notes on this page provide guidance that is sufficient for most people wanting to use language tags. There are links to relevant sections of BCP 47 in this margin for people who want to read the full text of the specification.</p>
</aside>
      <h3 id="subtagregistry"><a href="#subtagregistry">Accessing the subtag registry</a></h3>
      <p>All the subtags you will need to create a language tag are found in one place, the <strong><a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">IANA Language Subtag Registry</a></strong>. The registry is a long text file, containing nearly 8,000 entries. </p>
    <p>The first (and often only) subtag in a language tag always designates a language. It is referred to in BCP 47 as the <span class="newterm">primary language subtag</span>. We will use that term in this document to refer to the subtag that represents a language, to  more clearly make the distinction from 'language tag', which refers to the whole thing.</p>
    <div class="sidenoteGroup">
    <p>To find a primary-language subtag, search the page for the name of that language. For example, if you want to label something as French, searching
      for '<span translate="no">French</span>' in the registry will bring you to a record that looks like this:</p>
       <aside class="sideinfonote" style="clear:both;">
        <p class="warning">Some environments or systems may dictate choices that are different from what you would otherwise expect. For example, in Java you must use <code class="kw" translate="no">iw</code> (deprecated in BCP47) in place of <code class="kw" translate="no">he</code> (recommended in BCP47).</p>
      </aside>
 </div>
    <div class="example">
      <pre translate="no">%%
Type: language
Subtag: fr
Description: French
Added: 2005-10-16
Suppress-Script: Latn
%%</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Your search will have matched against the <code class="kw" translate="no">Description</code> field. Check that the type of this record is <code class="kw" translate="no">language</code>. What you are looking for is the value in the <code class="kw" translate="no">Subtag</code> field, ie. <code class="kw" translate="no">fr</code>.</p>
    <p>The rest of this article will provide advice for choosing primary language subtags and, where needed, other types of subtag. Note that not all the decisions about how to create a language tag are straightforward. There are circumstances where usage will dictate which of various possibilities you should follow.</p>
    <p>There are   tools available which provide additional help while searching the registry, such as the <a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/"> Language Subtag  Lookup</a> tool.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <mark>Think about letter-case.</mark>
          By convention, primary language subtags are lowercase, script subtags begin with an uppercase letter, and continue with lowercase, and region subtags are uppercase.  This is only a convention, however, and you are free to use whatever letter-casing you like.</p>
        <p>On the other hand,  you may be using language tags in a context where letter-case is important, such as file names on some systems. In such cases, you should ensure that you follow a consistent policy for letter-case; for any new system that is not case-insensitive, it is recommended that you follow the BCP 47 conventions.</p>

    <h3 id="langsubtag"><a href="#langsubtag">Decision 1: The primary language subtag</a></h3>
    <div class="sidenoteGroup">
      <p>You always start by choosing a primary language subtag, and often this is all you'll need for your language tag.</p>
      <div class="sidenote">
        <p>Read more in the BCP 47 spec: </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-2.2.1">2.2.1 Primary Language Subtag</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-4.1">4.1 Choice of Language Tag</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p style="font-weight:bold; font-style: italic;">Always bear in mind that the golden rule is to keep your  language tag as short as possible. Only add further subtags to your language tag if they are needed to distinguish the language from something else in the context where your content is used.</p>
    <p>When looking for a primary language subtag, there are a number of things to bear in mind.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <mark>Ensure you have the right language.</mark>
        Sometimes, it pays to check a few alternatives. Mark Davis, co-author of BCP47, writes &quot;Often it is not clear which language identifier to use. For example, what most people call Punjabi in Pakistan actually has the code 'lah', and formal name 'Lahnda'. There are many other cases where the same name is used for different languages, or where the name that people search for is not listed in the IANA registry.&quot;
        <p>You could look up language information in the <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/web.asp">SIL Ethnologue</a> and cross-reference that information with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=&amp;fulltext=Search">Wikipedia</a>. The Ethnologue uses the same three-letter codes as BCP47, but you'll need to <a href="http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp?order=639_1&amp;letter=a">convert BCP47 2-letter codes to their ISO 639-3 counterpart</a> to look up a language by code. (The <a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/"> Language Subtag  Lookup</a> tool does this for you.)</p>
        <p>There are a small number of cases where different language codes are available for what many people would regard as the same language, eg. Filipino and Tagalog, or Twi and Akan. There is no indication in the registry as to which you should use, but you should try to ensure that within a single application or context you are consistent.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <mark>Avoid collections.</mark>
        If the record you found has a field <code class="kw" translate="no">Scope: collection</code>, this subtag represents a group of languages that are descended from a common ancestor, are spoken in the same geographical area, or are otherwise related.
        <p>You should look for a more specific subtag for the language you are interested in. Unfortunately, the subtag registry doesn't provide any pointers for this.</p>
        <p>You can use these subtags if there is no more specific subtag available, and it is always preferable to use one of these rather than the subtags <code class="kw" translate="no">MUL</code> (multiple languages) or <code class="kw" translate="no">UND</code> (undefined).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <mark>Use macrolanguages with care.</mark>
        Some language subtags have a <code class="kw" translate="no">Scope</code> field set to <code class="kw" translate="no">macrolanguage</code>, ie. this primary language subtag encompasses a number of more specific primary language subtags in the registry.
        <p>For example, <code class="kw" translate="no">ku</code> (Kurdish) is a macrolanguage that encompasses <code class="kw" translate="no">ckb</code> (Central Kurdish), <code class="kw" translate="no">kmr</code> (Northern Kurdish), and <code class="kw" translate="no">sdh</code> (Southern Kurdish). </p>
        <p>You can find the more specific (ie. the encompassed) subtags by searching the registry for <code class="kw" translate="no">Macrolanguage: &lt;subtag_name&gt;</code>. Alternatively, the <a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/"> Language Subtag  Lookup</a> tool will automatically list these for a given macrolanguage (<a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/index.php?lookup=ar&amp;submit=Look+up">example</a>).</p>
        <p>As we recommended for the collection subtags mentioned above, in most cases you should try to use the more specific subtags, but there are a small number of important exceptions. These are  situations where you should continue using a macrolanguage subtag for reasons of backward compatibility. </p>
        <p>For example, although BCP 47 explains that <code class="kw" translate="no">zh</code> (the macrolanguage subtag for Chinese) doesn't actually specify which of the many, sometimes mutually unintelligible, dialects of Chinese is actually meant by this subtag, in practice  convention overwhelmingly  associates the macrolanguage subtag with the predominant language among the encompassed subtags - in this case, <code class="kw" translate="no">cmn</code> (Mandarin Chinese). If your application identified Mandarin Chinese in the past using the language tag <code class="kw" translate="no">zh-CN</code> (Chinese as used in Mainland China), or even just <code class="kw" translate="no">zh</code>, you can continue to use <code class="kw" translate="no">zh</code> in this way. Using <code class="kw" translate="no">cmn</code> or <code class="kw" translate="no">cmn-CN</code> may cause serious compatibility problems if  the software or users  expect a tag such as <code class="kw" translate="no">zh</code>.</p>
        <p>If, on the other hand, you are using <code class="kw" translate="no">zh</code> to refer to another Chinese dialect such as Hakka, you should use the language subtag <code class="kw" translate="no">hak</code> instead.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <mark>Avoid deprecated subtags.</mark>
        If the subtag record contains a <code class="kw" translate="no">Deprecated</code> field you shouldn't use this subtag. Usually the registry will indicate which alternative you should use in the <code class="kw" translate="no">Preferred-Value</code> field. For example, the subtag record for <code class="kw" translate="no">iw</code> (Hebrew) contains the two following fields:
        <blockquote>
          <pre translate="no">Deprecated: 1989-01-01
Preferred-Value: he</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This indicates that you should use the subtag <code class="kw" translate="no">he</code> for Hebrew instead.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the past, when dealing with lists of ISO codes, there were sometimes multiple codes for a given language - there could be a 2-letter code and one or two 3-letter codes. This ambiguity is resolved by the IANA Subtag Registry: only one code is listed per language. (If an ISO 2-letter code exists, that will be the code, otherwise it will be a three-letter code.) The registry maintainer also coordinates the ongoing evolution of the registry with developments in the ISO world.</p>

    <h3 id="extlangsubtag"><a href="#extlangsubtag">Decision 2: Extended language subtags</a></h3>
    <div class="sidenoteGroup">
      <p>The BCP 47 specification allows for an additional, 3-letter subtag immediately after the initial primary language subtag. This is called an <strong class="newterm">extended language subtag</strong> (abbreviated to <strong class="newterm">extlang</strong>). Only a relatively small number of extended language subtags are defined, and they each need to be used with a specific primary language subtag (given in the <code class="kw" translate="no">Prefix</code> field of the entry for the extended language subtag in the registry).</p>
      <div class="sidenote">
        <p>Read more in the BCP 47 spec: </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-2.2.2">2.2.2 Extended Language Subtags</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-4.1.2">4.1.2 Using Extended Language Subtags</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-4.1.1">4.1.1 Tagging Encompassed Languages</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Currently only seven primary language subtags can be used with extended language subtags. Six of those have a <code class="kw" translate="no">Scope</code> field set to <code class="kw" translate="no">macrolanguage</code> in the registry  (<code class="kw" translate="no">ar</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">kok</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">ms</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">sw</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">uz</code>, and <code class="kw" translate="no">zh</code>), and the other is <code class="kw" translate="no">sgn</code>. </p>
    <p>Consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <mark>Where possible,  use a single language subtag, rather than the language+extlang pair.</mark>
          There is always a 3-letter subtag that is equivalent to any language+extlang pairing, and it is always the same as the extlang subtag. For example, <code class="kw" translate="no">zh-yue</code> (Cantonese Chinese) can also be expressed with the single subtag <code class="kw" translate="no">yue</code>.</p>
        <p>The only significant exception is where the language+extlang sequence is established practice for the system you are working with; that is, where <code class="kw" translate="no">zh-yue</code> would be preferred rather than <code class="kw" translate="no">yue</code> to maintain backwards compatibility.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <mark>Take into account legacy usage for  predominant languages.</mark>
        In the section about primary language subtags we talked about the predominant language in the set of languages encompassed by a macrolanguage. We said that, to support legacy usage for a given application, it is generally better   to use the macrolanguage subtag for the predominant language, rather than the more specific subtag. For example, in such cases <code class="kw" translate="no">ar</code> (the Arabic macrolanguage subtag) may be more appropriate for Standard Arabic than <code class="kw" translate="no">arb</code> (the more specific, encompassed subtag that means Standard Arabic).
        <p>Similarly, when dealing with the predominant language in the set, it is generally better  for backwards compatibility if you replace the language+extlang sequence by just dropping the extlang, rather than using the extlang code as a primary language subtag.  For example, reducing <code class="kw" translate="no">ms-zsm</code> to <code class="kw" translate="no">ms</code> (Malay macrolanguage subtag) may sometimes be better than replacing it with <code class="kw" translate="no">zsm</code> (Standard Malay).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As an example of usage, Unicode's CLDR database uses macrolanguages <code class="kw" translate="no">zh</code> to represent Mandarin Chinese and <code class="kw" translate="no">ku</code> to represent Kurdish. Thus for Mandarin Chinese you would use <code class="kw" translate="no">zh</code>, not <code class="kw" translate="no">cmn</code>, and for Northern Kurdish you would use <code class="kw" translate="no">ku-Latn</code>, not <code class="kw" translate="no">kmr-Latn</code>. The CLDR database, however, does not use extended language subtags, so you would need to use <code class="kw" translate="no">yue</code> for Cantonese, not <code class="kw" translate="no">zh-yue</code>.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="scriptsubtag"><a href="#scriptsubtag">Decision 3: Script subtags</a></h3>
    <div class="sidenoteGroup">
      <p>Script subtags should only be used as part of a language tag when the script adds some useful distinguishing information to the tag. Usually this is because a language is written in more than one script or because the content has been transcribed into a script that is unusual to the language (so  one might tag Russian transcribed into the Latin script with a tag such as <code class="kw" translate="no">ru-Latn</code>).</p>
      <div class="sidenote">
        <p>Read more in the BCP 47 spec: </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-2.2.3">2.2.3  Script Subtag</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-4.1">4.1 Choice of Language Tag</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Script subtags are always 4 letters, and must come after any language or extended language subtag, but before any other subtags.</p>
    <p>Here are  things to look out for when choosing a script subtag.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <mark>Don't automatically use for non-written content.</mark>
        Content such as audio recordings should not need one of the usual script subtags.	For	example,	a	movie that is subtitled in Uzbek using the Arabic (rather than Latin) script might label the subtitles <code class="kw" translate="no">uz-Arab</code>, but the <code class="kw" translate="no">Arab</code> script subtag would not be relevant for an audio track.
        <p>The script subtag <code class="kw" translate="no">Zxxx</code> could  be used for non-written content, eg. <code class="kw" translate="no">uz-Zxxx</code>, as <code class="kw" translate="no">Zxxx</code> is the <code class="kw" translate="no">Code for unwritten documents</code>, but again this is only useful if such a distinction has to be made clear.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <mark>Check for suppress-script fields in the language subtag.</mark>
        Some language subtags have a <code class="kw" translate="no">Suppress-script</code> field set to a given script subtag. For example, the entry in the registry for en (English) contains:
        <blockquote><code translate="no">Suppress-Script: Latn</code></blockquote>
        <p>meaning that you should not use the <code class="kw" translate="no">Latn</code> (Latin) script subtag with this language.</p>
        <p>This is because nearly all English documents are written in the Latin script and it adds no distinguishing information. However, if a document were written in English mixing Latin script with another script such as Braille (<code class="kw" translate="no">Brai</code>), then it might be appropriate to indicate both scripts to aid in content selection (eg. for the application of style rules).</p>
        <p>Note, however, that not all language subtags that are strongly associated with a given script have suppress-script fields. You should not assume that you need to use a script if a suppress-script field is absent.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="regionsubtag"><a href="#regionsubtag">Decision 4: Region subtags</a></h3>
    <div class="sidenoteGroup">
      <p>Region subtags associate the language subtag you have chosen with a particular region of the world. Region subtags must come after any language or script subtags.</p>
      <p>Like script subtags, you should only use a region subtag if it contributes information needed in a particular context to distinguish this language tag from another one; otherwise leave it out. </p>
      <div class="sidenote">
        <p>Read more in the BCP 47 spec: </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-2.2.4">2.2.4 Region Subtag</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-4.1">4.1 Choice of Language Tag</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>For example, <code class="kw" translate="no">en-GB</code> might be a useful distinction for spell-checking, but the region subtag in <code class="kw" translate="no">ja-JP</code> is unlikely to be useful unless you are intentionally contrasting it with Japanese spoken in other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>There are two types of region subtag: 2-letter codes and 3-digit codes. The latter tend to identify multinational regions, rather than specific countries. For example, <code class="kw" translate="no">es-ES</code> means Spanish as spoken in Spain, whereas <code class="kw" translate="no">es-419</code> means Spanish as spoken in Latin America.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <mark>Avoid deprecated subtags.</mark>
          Check that the subtag you intend to use isn't deprecated. In the same way as for other types of subtag, the registry will normally tell what the replacement should be via the <code class="kw" translate="no">Preferred-Value</code> field. </p>
        <p>In some cases there is no <code class="kw" translate="no">Preferred-Value</code> field in a deprecated record, but sometimes the <code class="kw" translate="no">Comments</code> field contains advice. For example, under YU (Yugoslavia) you will find:</p>

          <pre translate="no">Deprecated: 2003-07-23

    <p>Variant subtags describe additional distinctions not captured by the other subtags. Typically these are dialects, written variations (such as spelling reforms), transcriptions, and the like. A variant subtag is usually five to eight characters long and can contain letters and/or digits. A few four digit subtags (usually representing a year) are also registered. Variant subtags must come after any language, script, and region subtags.</p>
    <p>The key thing to look out for when using variant subtags is the order in which they are used.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <mark>Check the  context and ordering  for variant subtags.</mark>
          Most variant subtag records in the registry have one or more <code class="kw" translate="no">Prefix</code> fields. The prefixes indicate with which subtags it is usually appropriate to use this variant. For example, <code class="kw" translate="no">pinyin</code> should generally be used in a language tag that also contains either the subtags <code class="kw" translate="no">zh</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">Latn</code> or the subtags <code class="kw" translate="no">bo</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">Latn</code>, since the entry for <code class="kw" translate="no">pinyin</code> contains the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre translate="no">Prefix: zh-Latn
Prefix: bo-Latn</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If you have a good reason, you could use a variant subtag with different subtags, eg. <code class="kw" translate="no">cmn-Latn-pinyin</code> would be a perfectly legal way to say Mandarin Chinese written with pinyin.</p>
        <p>Although <code class="kw" translate="no">zh</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">bo</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">Latn</code> are specified, this is a minimum requirement. It is also possible to include other subtags, such as a region subtag, in the language tag (where appropriate), eg. <code class="kw" translate="no">zh-Latn-CN-pinyin</code>.</p>
        <p>Amongst other prefix fields, the entry for variant subtag <code class="kw" translate="no">1994</code> contains</p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre translate="no">Prefix: sl-rozaj-biske</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>which indicates that it should  be used in a language tag that already contains two other variant subtags, <code class="kw" translate="no">rozaj</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">biske</code>. Any variant subtag  specified in a prefix field should come before the variant you have just looked up.</p>
        <p>There are some variant subtags that have no prefix field, eg. <code class="kw" translate="no">fonipa</code> (International Phonetic Alphabet). Such variants should appear after any other variant subtags with prefix information. </p>
        <p>If you plan to use more than one variant without a prefix, order them in terms of decreasing significance. If they are equally significant, order them alphabetically.  This will aid interoperability. </p>

    <p>These single-character subtags allow for extensions to the language tag. To date, only one extension subtag has been registered. The  subtag <code class="kw" translate="no">u</code> was registered by the Unicode Consortium  to add information about  language or locale behavior. Many locale identifiers require additional  &quot;tailorings&quot; or options for specific values within a language, culture,  region, or other variation. This extension provides a mechanism for  using these additional tailorings within language tags for general  interchange.</p>
    <p>For example, the following indicates that  phonebook collation order  should be used by an application, that sorted data in a document is  sorted according to this collation, and so on.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code class="kw" translate="no">de-DE-u-co-phonebk</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">u-</code> extension is defined in <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6067.txt">RFC 6067</a>,  which points to the Unicode Consortium's Common Locale Data Repository  (CLDR) for details on the subtags that follow it. It is not defined by  BCP 47.</p>

    <p>Private-use subtags do not appear in the subtag registry, and are chosen and maintained by private agreement between the parties that use them. They are introduced by a single letter subtag, or 'singleton'. The singleton for private use is <code class="kw" translate="no">x</code>.  Note that any subtags after the singleton can only be 8 characters in length, though you can use multiple subtags.</p>

          <mark>Private use subtags should be used with great care, and avoided whenever possible</mark>

        <p>As an example of a private use subtag, <code class="kw" translate="no">en-US-x-twain</code>, may identify a specific type of US English, but only within a closed community. Outside of that private agreement, its meaning cannot be relied upon.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Grandfathered tags are special cases, provided for backwards compatibility. They are tags that were registered before RFC 4646 that cannot be completely composed from the subtags in the current registry, or do not fit the syntax currently defined for language tags.</p>
    <p>Nearly all grandfathered tags have been superceded by subtags or combinations of subtags in the registry. Such grandfathered tags are now deprecated, and usually contain a <code class="kw" translate="no">Preferred-Value</code> field that indicates how you ought to represent that language instead. For instance, the entry in the registry for the grandfathered tag <code class="kw" translate="no">art-lojban</code> indicates that you should use the <code class="kw" translate="no">jbo</code> language subtag instead.</p>
    <p>Note that you should not use additional subtags with a grandfathered tag.</p>
